The timing of main meals and the lighting/dimming of the cabin were done sensitively.

Opting for Singapore Airlines, renowned for its outstanding reputation in both air travel and service, I anticipated nothing less than a seamless experience. The cost of this connecting flight amounted to MYR 1601, roughly USD 335, a price I was more than willing to pay for quality service. My journey commenced with a minor delay in takeoff from Penang. The flight proceeded smoothly, accompanied by a light snack comprising a slice of pizza and a beverage of choice. As we approached Changi Airport, the situation took an unexpected turn. The captain announced a delay in landing, estimating an additional 15 to 20 minutes before touchdown. A sense of unease crept over me as my connecting flight departure time loomed closer. Despite my concerns, I remained optimistic, trusting in the efficiency of Singapore Airlines to navigate any challenges seamlessly. Upon landing at 12:05 pm and disembarking at 12:18 pm, I was met with a startling realization. Rather than a smooth transition to my connecting flight, I was handed a new ticket, rescheduled for departure at 4:10 pm, accompanied by a SGD 15 food voucher for Burger King and Coffee Bean.  I sought clarity from the attendant, only to be met with dismissiveness. The absence of any acknowledgment or attempt at redress left me deeply disappointed. The disregard for my time and the indifferent handling of the situation underscored a gap in the airline's commitment to customer service. In retrospect, my expectation for exemplary hospitality and proactive problem-solving from a reputed airline like Singapore Airlines was regrettably unmet. As I reflect on this experience, I am reminded of the importance of genuine care and consideration in customer service, particularly in moments of inconvenience or distress.left me deeply disappointed",2024,02,18,embarked journey high hopes anticipation secured connecting ticket penang onwards jakarta opting renowned outstanding reputation air travel service anticipated nothing less seamless experience cost connecting amounted myr roughly usd price willing pay quality service journey commenced minor delay takeoff penang proceeded smoothly accompanied light snack comprising slice pizza beverage choice approached changi airport situation took unexpected turn captain announced delay landing estimating additional minutes touchdown sense unease crept connecting departure time loomed closer despite concerns remained optimistic trusting efficiency navigate challenges seamlessly upon landing pm disembarking pm met startling realization rather smooth transition connecting handed new ticket rescheduled departure pm accompanied sgd food voucher burger king coffee bean sought clarity attendant met dismissiveness absence acknowledgment attempt redress left deeply disappointed disregard time indifferent handling situation underscored gap commitment customer service retrospect expectation exemplary hospitality proactive problemsolving reputed like regrettably unmet reflect experience reminded importance genuine care consideration customer service particularly moments inconvenience distressleft deeply disappointed,0.046850649350649344,1310,155

My flight was terrible. To begin with my seat was broken and couldn’t be moved and the entertainment device was broken as well. My flight of nearly 8 hours was spent looking blankly into space, seated in the same position. I had severe back pain upon arrival as a result for the next couple of days. When I informed the crew, first the steward said I will be compensated with a voucher and asked me to choose what I like from the duty free catalog. When I did choose a product that would be useful for me, I was told by the air hostess that my voucher is only for $75 Singapore dollars and the rest will have to be paid by me! I informed them I don’t need their $75 voucher and that I will make a formal complaint about the plane’s defects. After my return I did make the complaint and they got back to me saying that another travel voucher of AU$200 will be issued to be used in my next flight with Singapore airlines. But the worst part was they lied and said I was offered another seat but I had declined saying I wanted to be seated next to my husband. This was an outrageous lie. At no point did they offer me another seat. This is very concerning. I would urge everyone flying in SQ next time, to either video any exchange with the crew in situations like this or get it in writing. After discussing with my husband, I informed them that I would not be flying with them in the near future so they can give me a cash voucher.

As we travelled Premium Economy we received priority boarding which was good especially as we were travelling with my 80 year old dad. Premium Economy is very good especially the Leg room, which is the main reason I wanted it and being over double some economy fares it satisfied our needs. Extra recline also made a difference and was bearable even when the person in front was reclining. The Premium Economy cabin only has 4 rows 2-4-2 and is separated from the main economy cabin which made it feel more spacious. We chose the back row so nobody behind us made it feel a little more private and a big gap between us and exit room economy in the next cabin. Flight was smooth and comfortable Staff were great. Helpful and very accommodating when needed. Food was good although had the option to Book the Cook prior to flight. I know some airlines are starting to increase leg room to 40 inches SIN (38) which would be great when you consider the extra money that is paid. On our return from Croatia at Frankfurt there were flight delays which meant we would miss our connection from SIN MEL But both Lufthansa an Singapore Airlines made this a much less stressful experience, in fact a great little adventure. At FRA we received meal vouchers and were updated regularly by helpful staff and when we arrived in SIN everything was organised as soon as we got of the plane.

The check-in area barely had any travelers when we arrived and we were greeted by an agent immediately. The horror began. Our ticket was a one-way ticket since we were going to Split, Croatia (our final destination) for a longer time period for us and, especially, our toddler boy (29 months old traveling with me and my wife of course) to enjoy time with family and friends. Therefore, we purchased an airline ticket for each of us and chose Singapore Airlines as a well-respected travel provider. Each of us had 2 check-in luggage, one carry-on, one backpack, and a car seat for our son. Leaving for an extended period of time with toddlers requires carrying a lot of luggage and we carefully packed it all, measured it, and tried to pay for extra weight online before flying. There was no option for it. As I was taking care of our son, my wife was checking us in at the counter (the first class counter right next to the business class counter in Row 8). I noticed that she became visibly distressed and that the agent was on the phone holding off the check-in procedure. I asked if everything was ok and she responded that the check-in agent was not letting us check in. What he and his supervisor who he was on the phone with, and who seemed to be a business class agent right next to us, said equals absolute harassment and a complete overstepping of their boundaries. They proceeded to tell us that we needed to purchase a separate return ticket each because we won’t be let in to stay in Croatia. This is unheard of, absolutely wrong, and untrue, a situation created by the agent and his supervisor that doesn’t exist. I am Croatian and an American citizen, and my wife and my son are American citizens who can enter Croatia with American passports as they wish. Then, the agent (still on the phone with the next counter supervisor) asked my wife if she had at least $8000 and after taking my Croatian passport said it would be fine for me but not for my wife who never changed her name - so was asked to produce proof of our marriage. Thankfully she carries our marriage certificate in case of this but for other countries as we travel - not for the US! And this “interrogation“ happened in an atmosphere of hostility where the agent and his supervisor, who at some point was having a laughing chat with one of his colleagues, behaved with utmost disrespect towards us as their/your client/customer. Zero courteous smile. Zero understanding. Zero any sort of empathy that we have a toddler with us. We knew that we would pay for extra weight in one piece of luggage (the 9 kg option we couldn’t do online). They proceeded to make us check our two carry-ons that were barely over 7kg (and this has never happened to me or my wife in our 25 years of global flying) at a cost of $700. The Crew and flight were great. The food was horrible and the seats were not too comfy. Also, the customer service was almost ignorant of our complaint and defended their agents' actions without any understanding.

When they realized, they were wrong, they subsequently changed their position to cancellation and re-booking of our flight by their customer service agents. We did not cancel the flight but it was an error committed by their customer agent. . When the customer service agent re-booked our flight they ensured us that our original seats selection would be the same. We periodically checked with the customer service agents to ensure that our original seats selection were intact. They confirmed and re-confirmed that our original paid seats were unchanged. We also went on to their on-line booking website to confirm that our original seat selections remained intact. On checking in (2 days before flight), we discovered that one of our paid seats was re-assigned to another customer without our prior knowledge and approval. We discovered our seat was re-assigned to a standard seat to the back of the plane. Immediately. we called the customer service agents immediately on the phone to reinstate our paid seats back but they refused to do it. The customer service agents on the phone did not converse well in English and they gave us all the wrong information about the seat change. It was extremely difficult to get through to them on the phone and we had to wait for a long time before we could speak to someone.  The duty manager at airport informed us our paid seat had been changed last minute due to a preferred customer had kicked us out due to his importance. It was unprofessional and unethical for them to do that. We had to fight and argue fervently all the way through at each encounter. Even at the gate, we had to fight and argue to get our seat back after seeking approval from the preferred customer. Escalated the complaints to the senior management (CEO) several times who did not even respond to our complaints.. Actual costs incurred to resolve the airline mistakes amounted to SGD429.65 and they only agreed to issue a voucher of SGD75 which is inadequate to compensate for the actual costs incurred. Moreover, it does not include the additional inherent cost of lost vacation time and stress/frustrations to deal with their mistakes that they had created for us unnecessarily. Customer service investigation focused mainly on the outcome but do not provide fair customer resolution to their mistakes they had committed.

The delay according to Singapore Airlines was caused by traffic control between Guangzhou and Singapore and the plane had to be diverted to Kuala Lumpur to refuel for more than 2 hours on the tarmac. We missed the connecting flight SQ38 on August 9th to LAX as a result. We were placed in a hotel by SQ adjacent to the airport for a sudden 24hour plus layover near midnight with a ""food coupon"" that we had to fight for as we were starving due to the long delay and no food service on the plane. After arriving at the hotel we found out that those food vouchers were not even valid according to the hotel, Capri by Fraser, and no food service was available. Capri by Fraser's on duty manager in Singapore apparently said they don't take ""food coupons"" from Singapore Airlines for emergency layover guests and that this was a miscommunication with SQ. At near midnight where nearly all restaurants were closed and Capri is far from the city center, how were we expected to get a meal after being misled by Singapore Airline staff at the airport about the availability of food and their miscommunication? What if we were first time guests in Singapore with no knowledge of the local language and not able to navigate the situation? This is a complete failure from a management perspective as logically delayed passengers who miss a connecting flights after a certain time should at least be informed properly if not put in a hotel with 24 room service/dining options in or nearby and given the courtesy of not having to worry about starving on top of rearranging travel plans etc. For an airline with a world class reputation where one pays a premium for the service this just is not acceptable. I submitted a complaint to Singapore Airlines but their complains team threw a response back at me: “as much as we acknowledge the inconvenience you went through as a result of the delay, as an industry practice, and in line with our Conditions of Contract and Carriage, we would like to share that airlines generally do not compensate for consequential losses or inconvenience arising from flight delays.” However, I know international passenger rights stemming from Article 19 of the Montreal Convention. When I brought this up to an SQ customer service supervisor after spending hours on call trying to reach someone who I could speak to about this, I was shocked and concerned to find out that not even supervisor level reps knew about one of the most important international passenger rights conventions. SQ repeatedly mislead and misrepresent int'l passenger rights trying to brush me off. Currently they have ceased responding to my emails and appears to think that ignoring the issue will fix it. I don't know what more I can do at this point but I hope this review will serve to shed light on the holes in SQ's 5 star service and World's Best Airline reputation.

The problem was no calf support and any way shape or form, this has a big impact on leg comfort. There was a flap thing that came out but onlyto the back of the knee which was so useless. The second problem was there was no tunnel to slide into for a flat sleeping position. Instead of the tunnel there was a shelf that had to be pulled out but this was to the side of the seat. Instead of laying flat which we were supposed to achieve the side shelf meant sleeping at an angle which was so uncomfortable.

However, I was extremely disappointed with their service, especially the catering on board a 7hr flight from Brisbane to Singapore. The aircraft was a new A350, and I had a nice bulkhead seat which allowed me to stretch out. The inflight entertainment was quite good, and the redeeming factor for this flight. Unfortunately, the service and staff was mediocre, and not warm or approachable as I remembered. The food was just awful, especially for a medium haul flight, which consisted of meat and veggies just piled on top of gooey rice. Not even a salad or appetiser (which they used to serve), and a cold bun (there was an ice cream dessert). The washroom was filthy, wet and sticky floor, toilet paper in the sink, even just after the first hour or so, and clearly the crew did not pay much attention to cabin cleanliness (unlike other airlines, where I've seen crew inspect the facilities and do a bit of cleaning).

This is the longest leg of return trip from SE Asia with Hubby. The flight is full, mostly with couples and single travelers. In Singapore there is another security check at the waiting room gate, and most travelers didn't realize they have to go through it to go to the waiting room. Many of the these are the infrequent or first time travelers who don't know that they have to scan their electronics and take off their belts jackets and caps off again, making a long line that moved very slow. Boarding was done by zone and was quite orderly, however there was still a line of latecomers going through the waiting room gate check when the boarding begins. This makes the flight have to leave 25 minutes later than scheduled. The FAs were all wearing masks as per their company's precaution and safety awareness policy. However they were all still very friendly, personable, helpful, courteous and polite, and dedicated in giving their best service. The service started as soon as we reached cruising altitude, started with a drink service then dinner, and a second drink service after that. Many of the travelers are Indians so the FAs quickly ran out of the vegetarian meal option that my Hubby was interested in and he had to settle for chicken with pasta, which is very good. After dinner the lights were turned off so people can sleep, but we were told that snacks is available in between the dinner and lunch that will be served 2 hours prior to landing. The cockpit crew communicated well, explaining about the flight plan before we leave and updating us of LAX condition before our descent. They were very good in identifying possible turbulence ahead so we always get notifications to fasten our seat belts before it hits. Restrooms were always kept clean and the FA frequently refresh them with deodorizer. The entertainment system is amazing and full of latest movies as usual, and it's hard to pick and choose what you want to watch next. As with our previous SQ flight, this aircraft has large 11"" touchscreen with a USB ""A"" that works, and the headphone plug requires two prongs, however it still works well with my wireless headphone adapter which only has one plug. The seat slides forward as you recline so it is a better position to get some rest in a semi reclining position. The lights were turned on just before drink service and lunch was served, and the FAs worked hard to serve us and get everything done before we start our descent into LAX. We arrived at LAX 1 hour ahead of schedule thanks to the strong tailwind. During a bathroom break I casually mentioned to one of the FAs that the day before was my birthday and this trip is to celebrate both our birthdays and our 10 years anniversary. After lunch suddenly we were given two cakes with two glasses of champagne with a ""happy anniversary"" written on the plate, and a card from the crew! Wow, I didn't see that coming!

The flight used a 78X and it was full of vacationers mostly families, and many of them may have not traveled by air before so it takes time to line everybody up for boarding. Boarding was done by zones and it was a good thing that boarding time was an hour before departure time, because ground staff had to weed out people lining up not in their boarding zone. The flight attendants were as usual with SQ, very nice courteous and polite, and very helpful even with the most clueless passengers. Soon we were all seated and left just 15 minutes behind. Service started as soon as the plane level off, and the FAs were very efficient yet friendly and communicative. One of them even gave us our second round of Singapore Sling without us asking, and we really appreciate him! For a short 2 hours flight the FAs were able to do two beverage service and a meal in between, and that must be quite a challenge for them! The meal offered are using their new sustainability concept, with paper containers and bamboo cutlery so they can be recycled. We found this an excellent proof that SQ is serious in their effort to go green and reducing use of non-biodegradable materials like plastics. The paper container is quite sturdy and even retains good heat for my Nasi Lemak. The portion was a bit smaller but the taste is just the same compared to past ones I had on SQ.

Both flights were the morning A380 flights in Premium Economy. So we’ve had best part of 27 hours experiencing the Premium Economy product. Boarding for both flights was painless. Both flights left on time and arrived slightly early. The premium economy cabin on the A380 is right at the front and as such feels quite exclusive. Indeed there are only about 40 seats in the cabin in a 2-4-2 configuration. To keep this review brief. The seats were a major upgrade on the usual economy seats both in comfort and space. The food was lovely - we used Book the Cook for all our meals. Plenty of drinks brought around and if you needed a top up or a snack this was provided promptly. Again on both flights the cabin crew were amazingly good. We paid about £600 each extra over and above the economy fare, which at the time of booking meant our premium economy fare was double the economy fare. So an extra £300 each way to be in Premium Economy. Is it worth it? Well yes it is , but I add a proviso. It’s worth paying extra, as long as the extra you pay is no more than around £600-£700 for long haul return. £600 economy vs £1200 Premium, that a no brainer. If you have the cash then do it.

Lounge - SilverKris Changi is huge and was too over crowded. We had to sit at a canteen type table which was uncomfortable. We only stayed long enough to change our sim and change clothes. Way too busy. Gate/Boarding. We got in line. Was told there was no point as it hadn’t opened. We stayed in line as seats get taken in there fast. Boarding passes are scanned after security which meant the one gate agent could not cope when it was boarding time and everyone stormed the gate not adhering to groups or priority. Seat - narrow. Overhead lockers were too high for me to reach even with the little foot aid thing. Others had to help. No other storage except under the foot rest. There is a tiny cubby hole where ear phones, menu and water bottle were kept. Not a comfortable seat to sleep in being so narrow with no wriggle room. Hard being a side sleeper. Food - As all my other flights had poor quality food I opted for no meal, just sleep. The passenger in front argued with the FA over no breakfast service. Personally I believe there should have been a choice but no. The lovely FA verified no meal with me and offered to keep cheesecake aside that she would serve to me with coffee when I woke which was lovely of her. As I woke an hour or so before landing she was right there with what was promised. On arrival luggage arrived quickly so we were one of the first through customs with no long line. Overall the crew really are the highlight with Singapore Airlines. The rest is average to below average with definite cut backs evident.

There was no such cancellation of flights as the flight number of the ""cancelled"" flight was the exact same flight as the one that he proposed.

When we got on the flight the seat part of my daughters seat was missing. She was seated in 54k next to the window. Somebody came and replaced it so she could sit down. We all fell asleep immediately as it was almost 1am in the morning Sydney time. Half way through the flight my daughter realised her socks were wet. We had a look at them and realised they stank of vomit. We then checked all of her toys and our bags that were on the floor and they were all damp and stank of vomit. All of her things, shoes, socks and bottom of her trousers just absolutely stank of vomit and the ground was soaking wet. I can not believe that after such a terrible pandemic my daughter was allowed to sit in an area where someone had so obviously recently been vomiting. Not to mention how disgusting it has been travelling to our hotel in a car with bags all covered in sick and smelling absolutely terrible. I complained to the air steward and asked her to make a note as it was such a disgusting way to have to sit on a long haul flight. Our short UK holiday absolutely ruined, not being able to see my terminally ill father for 8 days in fear of passing it to him, which his immune system could not have handled. This after not seeing him due to the pandemic for 3 years! I understand we flew economy, but at the very least we expected the seats to be clean and sanitary. I emailed the airline through my husbands official Singapore Airlines account, and we heard nothing. I emailed several times, nothing. I only got a response from the airline when I involved a third party resolver government site that helps consumers. They told me nothing had been reported, and that the airline staff deny this even happened. So at the very least they are not logging and recording the changing of seats which must be a safety issue. I find very hard to believe the air steward doesn't remember covering the vomit floor with a blanket and spraying air freshener over it for us. I also asked her to log it all, and she said she would.

The meals, are okay by all means but when i compare this to Emirates or Qatar, they are very basic in the sense that all you get is a main dish, bread, crackers, cheese and a small desert of some kind.

No warm welcome back  by the leading stewardess. No welcome-drinks, no hot-towel and with the exception of slippers no amenities. For my after take-off drink I opted for a hot sake. Together with satays as canapés I got a tiny 4cl glass of sake and not the full 180ml bottle. One different guest, however enjoyed the whole bottle by his own – another example, that Solitaire-PPS-membership does not pay out anymore. I ordered a Gin&Tonic instead, delivered to me with my own lemons, which I brought from the Lufthansa-lounge. I also brought my own Lufthansa-refreshing-towels, which the crew chilled for me and brought to me after meals and sleeping. The starter (beef pastrami) was tiny but tasty. The chicken roulade with pretzel stuffing was a pretzel roulade with lots of pretzel outside and a tiny piece of chicken inside, dry and almost tasteless. My choice of wine (Australian Shiraz) was disappointing. Ironically, SIA re-introduced a printed menu, even featuring its ‘wine connoisseurs’ – but the actual wine-list was missing, so I could not verify the exact origin of my wine. The cheese-plate was disappointing consisting of 2 small tiny bits only (before it was at min. 3 choices, being freshly cut) with no grapes, as before. At least the Pumpkin Seed Parfait was nice and I was lucky to get the chocolate cake on request. No pralines. My choice of digestive, the Aberfeldy 16 years’ single malt was not catered for and a Japanese whiskey was offered instead. Why then having a single malt on the menu? As SIA doesn’t hand out any amenities to its business-class passengers,  I brought my own slippers and amenity-kit from a flight with Austrian earlier. The next disappointment was the economy-class-style breakfast with scrambled eggs or egg-noodles (2 different styles, though) and yoghurt or muesli. The only difference to an economy-class breakfast is, that the dishes are being served one after each other, but the sizes are tiny. I was lucky, there were still the seafood noodle soup from lunch left, so I decided for that. No freshly squeezed orange-juice. Thank you SIA for a good flight-experience before Covid.

On the surface, customer service seemed normal but it was a far cry from the past and not worth the extra money to upgrade from Economy Premium. If you are short like me, sleeping in the cubby hole, in a flat position is fine. Getting the seats up/down is a ridiculous exercise requiring assistance. Not the least bit convenient. It took 4+ hours for the flight staff to get my audio working. Food was some of the worst yet. Trying to get a glass of wine refilled was arduous. Because of all the stories of airline cancellations and delays, I did not risk flying from PDX to SFO with a short layover. Certainly 5 hours was sufficient. Because of the lame check-in policies and process for getting a boarding pass, I was forced to wait 3+ hours for the Singapore counter to open.  The United Lounge at SFO was great. On the flight, it was more of the same, as in the flight to SFO. In addition to the wait for a rest room, no amenities (like socks or travel kit) was offered to me.

Singapore Airlines travel was Brisbane to Munich and Frankfurt to Brisbane, both of course, via Singapore. Both trips were 'busy' business trips where everything needed to be on time and hassle-free. Singapore Airlines exuded high quality personal service. Aircraft were spotless and cabins quiet, including on one sector (Singapore-Brisbane) when a number of babies turned up. Disappointing was the food and wine including the choices available. Emirates was far better in this category. Also, Singapore Airlines had no hot towels or printed menus. Maybe this was due to recent COVID issues but the comparison with Emirates was stark. Also Lounge access and quality was very poor. The Silver Kris Lounge in Singapore at midnight resembled a packed works canteen on a bad day. Boarding was quite chaotic at a number of places, especially at Frankfurt - which often seems to be the case for these Singapore Airlines A380 flights out of Frankfurt.

The call centre operator informed us that all the economy tickets were sold on those flights, so we have an option to purchase Premium Economy tickets by paying an extra $937.60 NZD. We were charged this amount on 6th of March. We were excited to come back to Auckland and for first time in our life in Premium Economy. Unfortunately, our excitement was totally crushed when we realized we can only board the plane in economy class upon check in online.

We have been unable to travel to New Zealand for almost 3 years due to the pandemic. As borders were finally open we booked flights with Singapore Airlines, which were more expensive than any other airline, thinking spending more money would be worth it after such a long wait .. how wrong were we! Our outbound flight, SQ 305 on 17 March 2022 from London to Singapore was delayed by 1 hour and 53 minutes, which led to us being unable to make our connection flight to Auckland, SQ 281 on 18 March 2022. They then had a technical fault also and the flight was further delayed, causing our missed connection time to Auckland. The staff onboard the plane had no idea what was going to happen, and even though most of the aircraft had connections to make, they gave us no information and were incredibly unhelpful. Once we arrived in Singapore, it was an even worse state of affairs. We were greeted by a makeshift desk with everyone scrambling to give out new tickets (there were literally hundreds of people with missed connections). We were told we had missed our flight, and the next connection was 14 hours away. No food vouchers, no hotel rooms offered. We were told all the airport hotels were booked, however we walked to and managed to get a room, at our own cost. The next flight was also packed, and even though my partner and I had paid extra money for seats together, the new plane was unable to accommodate this and we had to sit separately. My partner has food intolerances, and none of his meals was catered for on the next 10-hour-long flight. He was offered some crisps and that was all for the entire flight. We honestly could not believe how bad the whole journey had been and arrived in Auckland completely and utterly exhausted. A really bad start to a trip we had been looking forward to for such a long time. On our return flight, we luckily made our connection. I would say the meals and customer service have gone downhill and it did not feel like we were traveling on a premium airline. Since being home, we have complained to Singapore Airlines and asked for a refund/compensation for our outward flight and the hotel we had to pay for.

The check in at LHR was seamless even with the necessary Covid checks in place and being done efficiently by the check in staff.

The food service was efficient and rapid and there was a wide selection of other snacks available with a fruit bowl also with crisps etc for during the flight. The flight to Manila was smooth, service was also great even in the smaller less crowded flight. The staff continued to deliver amazing professionalism and attention to detail. The attention to detail became very noticeable on the return flight from Singapore to London. After another comfortable and pro professional flight from Manila I boarded the flight to London and for reasons unknown, my booked seat hadn't been reserved.  I was one of the first on, as I prefer to also sit at the back of the plane, and I mentioned it to the cabin crew who immediately took me off the plane, against the flow of oncoming passengers (I was that guy and felt very embarrassed) took me to the ground staff who radioed to the gate to change my boarding pass to an aisle seat which they did without any fuss or questions asked. As I had now moved seats and there are only so many meals in the trolley to cater for the expected number of passengers in each specific areas on the plane, my moving now had to be factored in and to my surprise I overheard once cabin crew day to the other ""Mr Taylor has moved from seat 67f to 46h"". When I left the plane the cabin crew by the door said ""Thank you for flying, See you again soon Mr Taylor"" Overall Singapore airlines for me is hands down the best and aside from the ground team at Singapore airport the experience was amazing and I will definitely be booking my flights with them again.

The flight time from MAN-SIN-MAN is longer due to the war in Ukraine and Russian airspace being closed - I reckon at least two hours more. I was a bit frustrated that the two meals were on opposite ends of that 14 hours. The lack of a printed menu (due to Covid - which I couldn’t understand as these have always been printed and distributed fresh anyway) meant that half way through the first 14 hours I actually paid for a bit of internet access, so I could see what refreshments were on offer (it was supposed to be free to do this, but I couldn’t work it out - although in hindsight, I should have just asked!). I was so hungry - the meals, refreshment and alcohol servings were just way too small. Entertainment is great, and the upgrade IFE since I last flew SQ a while back was nice. Seating in Economy is good (always nice to have three of four legs with a free seat next to me), although one the A380 the seat angle was very far back - some people like that, I didn’t.

Singapore to Melbourne flight, SQ237. Seated in 63H, towards the back. The flight was full, the first day the Australian border was open. The boarding procedure at Changi Airport Terminal 3. Users of Changi will know the security for flights at Changi is typically at the individual Departure Gate. Unlike at other airports where it tends to be before entering the Terminal. At Terminal 3 they've decided to do all the security for 4 gates, you are then in this little pig pen with 3 other flights, potentially 1500 people, it's not big enough. The lines for the different flights cross each other, and there is little by way of organisation. No one seemed to be in charge, when I politely mentioned it didn't seem very organised I was met with a blank stare. I didn't expect this at Changi Airport. A cheerful and informative crew, attentive to people's needs, even in Economy. The plane interior is pleasant, it was clean. The inflight entertainment was all right. OK, the food. Flight was at 00:30 hours, so there was no dinner, shortly after takeoff we went to lights out, with breakfast to be served 3 hours out of Melbourne. Meanwhile the hostesses came round on a regular basis with glasses of water. Breakfast arrived, lightly cooked sausages, scrambled egg, beans, and some nasty pasta tomato sauce, that smells of capsicum. The egg seemed to consist of only yoke, a small spoonful was enough to confirm it wasn't fit for consumption. I'm a keen airline food eater, I enjoy the tray format, and I'm not too fussy, but this was inedible. I complained and asked for the alternative, vermicelli noodles with some stir fried chicken. It wasn't great, too much vermicelli and not enough sauce, but it was adequate. An hour or so later, a senior hostess came and chatted with me, and asked me what was wrong, I described the egg, she said someone else had also complained, I thanked her for asking me. I had an extremely good Nasi Lemak going up to Bangkok from Singapore on January 8th with Scoot, so the Changi kitchens can produce good food, and needless to say Singapore is famous for its food. Please SQ, don't serve food which doesn't pass muster. At 5am Singapore Time most of us would be quite happy with a Continental breakfast.

The cushioning is very thin and hard which is uncomfortable and the seats themselves are poorly constructed. The seat in front of me would buckle and bend every time the average size person in it moved which meant my knees copped a pounding given they were crammed up against the seat because of the reduction in space.  These new seats negate SIA from being a feasible selection as an airline for me. Thankfully the plane from Singapore to Manchester had not suffered the same upgrade and was a reminder of how bad the Melbourne – Singapore update is.  The meals were also underwhelming compared to pre-pandemic with very basic options and accompaniments. It took them 3 hours after take off to provide food and remove the trays due to having only one trolley cart servicing each aisle in the economy cabin. The whole experience very much smacked of an airline that has been taken over by bean-counters and they are cutting costs at every turn possible with cramming more people on the plane and providing less food and staff, and ultimately an experience that is a shade of SIA's glory days pre-pandemic.seats are a step back in quality",2022,01,14,ive got say experience flying melbourne – – melbourne completely turned off new fit outs reduced seat pitch seats step back quality cushioning thin hard uncomfortable seats poorly constructed seat front would buckle bend every time average size person moved meant knees copped pounding given crammed seat reduction space new seats negate sia feasible selection thankfully manchester not suffered upgrade reminder bad melbourne – update meals also underwhelming compared prepandemic basic options accompaniments took hours take off provide food remove trays due one trolley cart servicing aisle economy cabin whole experience much smacked taken beancounters cutting costs every turn possible cramming people providing less food staff ultimately experience shade sias glory days prepandemicseats step back quality,-0.10803030303030303,811,116

I had flown SA for many short hauls in Asia, but the discomfort on this trip was due to the routing, the business class set-up, the time in which this route took off, and the poor communication that is truly what SA seems to thrive on, the latter being years of frustration with flying with them; One can never get a person to speak with whether in Asia, NYC or LA. I had over 400K miles therefore I was getting award tickets, in business class, which I have flown for over 40 years consistently. The only ticket available for mileage went through Frankfurt, which meant I had to leave the plane (after 6 hours, middle of the night, but too early in Europe to have any of the lounges open), go through transit and feel like a zombie. (thank you Canada Air for being open and having showers!) But let's talk about the poor design of business class and lack of comfort. These were not staggered seating, so there was no privacy, the ""bed"" could not be done by mere mortals pushing buttons, its construction was convoluted and byzantine, such that an attendant had to physically configure the flat bed and mattress etc. So uncomfortable, as one had to contort oneself to actual fit the length. In the staggered layouts they are already at an angle. Any other flat bed can easily go from seat to bed with button pushing. I have flown to Asia and back from the USA no less than 50-60 times in the last decade and the choices of airlines with better routes and greater comfort, such as JAL, Qatar, Cathay and years ago even Malaysia Air. I don't understand why this airline gets such high marks? I know their agenda: to extend their reach and become a premier European carrier. I will continue to fly SA in Asia for very short hauls, but if I decide to go to Vietnam after many months in delightful Indonesia, it will not be on SA. I have other qualms, but let's face it, flying during this particular phase of the pandemic, with non-stop testing, non-stop mask wearing, abbreviated services, and less perks were not enough to make me stop traveling, but I thought, ""Well, I am in good hands"". The flying itself was lovely, (that was 21 hours, not counting stops in Frankfurt + Singapore). Good Grief! I have my return ticket on the same route in 5 months; I'll need my strength to just find out if there will be any other choice.

I was bitterly disappointed in my recent flying experience with them; from poor quality food to reduced service levels. The crew was still wonderful, but that can't make up for the overall feeling I was left with. Forget your business class comfort pack (in my view, covid19 is not a reasonable excuse for why this has been dropped), you now need to take your own eye patches/earplugs to be able to sleep if you are prone to light/sound. Instead, you'll receive a covid19 kit so you can clean your own cabin area. Meals were of such poor quality that I wished I had brought my own sandwiches. No menus are available so you have to try and listen to rather badly-pronounced meal choices to make your selection. I chose chicken and rice which turned out to be bland and gristly, with practically uncooked chicken skin (see photos). Apparently, the different meal choice of the passenger to my left did not go down well as they also left theirs untouched. My breakfast choice; scrambled eggs and sausage were served practically cold. Excessive amounts of plastic being used in meal preparation is also very disappointing in a world trying on the whole to reduce plastic. This is hands-down the worst experience in business class that I have ever experienced and was compounded by the overly-officious ground staff yelling at us (in hazmat-like suits) to walk in single file as we were marched to a 'holding area' rather than a business class lounge. In this holding area, not even water was on offer. Other lines of passengers transiting on different flights were ordered to stand against the wall whilst our group passed by. My very strong advice, whilst covid19 continues to plague travel, is don't transit through Singapore or use Singapore Airlines. reduce both the level and quality of service",2021,10,17,fear future travel appear use excuse reduce level quality service especially previously renowned class operation like bitterly disappointed recent flying experience poor quality food reduced service levels crew still wonderful but cant make overall feeling left forget business class comfort pack view not reasonable excuse dropped need take eye patchesearplugs able sleep if prone lightsound instead youll receive kit clean cabin area meals poor quality wished brought sandwiches no menus available try listen rather badlypronounced meal choices make selection chose chicken rice turned bland gristly practically uncooked chicken skin see photos apparently different meal choice passenger left not go down well also left untouched breakfast choice scrambled eggs sausage served practically cold excessive amounts plastic used meal preparation also disappointing world trying whole reduce plastic handsdown worst experience business class ever experienced compounded overlyofficious ground staff yelling us hazmatlike suits walk single file marched holding area rather business class lounge holding area not even water offer lines passengers transiting different flights ordered stand wall whilst group passed strong advice whilst continues plague travel dont transit use reduce level quality service,-0.07896825396825397,1300,180

The company touted customers' ability to change their flights for free, even being able to change a flight for free and having one free change after September 30, which would allow them to delay their flight well into 2022. I was able to easily change the flight until mid-September. After that point, I wasn't allowed to change it online and needed to call in which required over 1 hour of waiting. In September I could have changed my return flight to far into the future. In fact, the return leg of my flight was 2 months and 1 day after the initial flight. When I called in to push my flight date back, the customer service agent said I must upgrade my flight to rebook and that there was a minimum required stay of 2 months, meaning I couldn't have a the return leg of the flight more than two months after the initial one. First of all, my return flight was already more than 2 months later and before they restricted online flight changes, I could have changed my flight to much later dates.  The agent also told me the flight change would cost over 900 USD, more than the original round-trip ticket. I requested to speak to a manager. She denied my request and said she would talk to her team. After 30 minutes of being on hold, she said I could book my flight a maximum of one month past the current return date. This was not part of the agreement when I originally booked the flight. Now, however, I didn't need to upgrade the flight for some reason, but the change would cost 490 USD. Booking a one-way ticket at that time cost 497 USD. The agent explained that the difference was in the price of the flight. Nothing she said made sense.

As a First-Class passenger and there are only 4 first class seats on the flight to LAX, SQ could, in the very least, confirm with me the refund amount and obtain my consent before refund. And after I disputed the refund amount as being unreasonably low (not enough for me to buy another one-way first-class ticket back), they should have the courtesy to handle the communication with the customer better and in a more timely manner. So, I have requested for a reinstatement of my ticket instead of the refund on by emailing and calling customer service of SQ on June 5 and got a reply on June 30 that still under investigation.

Secondly, I have a non-refundable domestic flight (not SIA) that I can no longer use with the new itinerary so I have to buy a new USD 100 ticket. So, I am USD 100 out of pocket.

My flight from Changi to Europe would be the same. So, I would have a 5 hour lay-over in Changi instead of 3 hours. SIA replied that they could do that but asked me to pay a change fee. I declined and took my original flight.

Wonderful attentive service from the FAs on both flights. The food served was good on both flights, in fact the ""supper"" (chicken thigh, mashed potato and steamed veg with gravy) on the A380 was exceptionally good for economy class. Sadly the breakfasts remain poor. They continue to serve these awful chicken sausages instead of a decent pork sausage (the ONLY thing BA does better than SQ) and the eggs are failures; either a rubbery omelette or scrambled egg that is sloppy and lacks flavour. I did notice some cost saving measures that I had not previously seen on SQ. No amenity kits, which I did not miss but no longer serving sachets of salt and pepper with the meals is a mistake. Airline meals generally lack flavour so I did miss the black pepper. There was also a smaller selection of snacks in the galley.

It was quite okay at the first place, then the meal time came up. I struggled not to spill other's passengers meal with my elbow because it was narrow. The entertainment system was really new. It had a lot of different options there and it was up to date. It was 5 hours 25 minutes flight. We just had one time meal and one snack time. It was okay tho. There were 2 options such as Korean or Western menus. I opted Korean one with the menu of Bibimbap. It was just okay since bibimbap was only vegetable and beef mixed with Korean condiments and. The cabin was clean and the most interesting of this aircraft that the window shades was electric by dimming the windows colour. It was nice!

Great service. The seats were comfortable in business, although they could be less comfortable for a tall person. With the 787s, the space between the seat and the TV monitor is quite narrow and when the table is out, one must sit quite upright. It is not as comfortable as the Airbus or Qatar’s q-suites but definitely way better than 99% of other airlines. I had the lobster thermidor and was happy that this is much better now - tender yet creamy sauce. There are Asian drinks on board, such as umeshu, which is brilliant.

Random thing is 2 previous legs and several other flights with SQ this wasn't an issue but we were told it was a new rule. Odd thing cabin crew never heard of it and 3 days later from SIN-MUC there were no issues with it being taken as hand luggage. Flight boarded late due to a late arrival but some of the time was made up with a near on time arrival. The 787 has a tighter configuration than the A350 regional configuration. This means less seat width and what I perceived as a little less leg room. Plane was spotless. Given the choice I would take the A350 over the 787 as it has it beat in all areas. Crew were more or less going through the motions and a bit robotic. Entertainment options still top, not even with 4 legs flow in the same month did you run out of things to watch.

Upon arrival in Hong Kong I discovered that one of my suitcases was damaged (zipper was damaged and could not be used anymore)/I went straight to their handling agent and was offered 3 options: 1) they could provide me with a report for my travel insurance, 2) They could try to fix it or 3) I was offered 500 HKD (50 Euro) as compensation. I argued with them that they destroyed the luggage so why should my insurance pay for their damaged caused, also the 500HKD would never cover a new suitcase (bought a year ago) so I asked to see somebody from Singapore airlines .. a girl appeared and immediately the same offer was made but the amount got up to 800HKD .. I argued that the money wouldn't even cover a new one. So she agreed to have my luggage picked up from my place in Hkg and tried to have it repaired. Nothing happened for 3 days and I was forced to contact the airline direct. Anyway suitcase was picked up on Thursday and was told on Saturday afternoon that they couldn't fix it and would offer me 1080HKD (no idea how they came to that amount) and it was a take it or leave it deal.

The incoming flight was delayed as the preceding flight was late departing the gate, and only arrived at the time boarding was supposed to start. However following a very quick turnaround and very efficiently organised boarding, the flight departed on time. There was the usual warm welcome from the crew, who were very active helping passengers stow belongings and settle in. Singapore Airlines do not offer pre-departure drinks, unlike most airlines in premium economy. The seat is comfortable, with good legroom and recline. The calf rest serves little purpose, and is difficult to retract when deployed, which is usually by accident. It was noted that very few passengers used the calf rest. The cabin overall is very pleasant. Service commenced promptly after take off. There was no separate drinks run, which is understandable with a late departure. The meal can best be described as typical airline food, the best part being the ice cream. Service and food is strictly economy class, no crockery nor tablecloth, and from Johannesburg no opportunity to book the cook. Drinks are served in plastic tumblers, with a somewhat meagre offering. A good champagne is offered in premium economy, but in a plastic faux stemmed glass that is even smaller than the standard tumbler. No refills are offered until the trays are cleared somewhat later. Both my wife and I were able to sleep for several hours, and it seemed quite strange to be woken up from a deep sleep to be offered lunch. This was about two hours before landing, which was ahead of schedule. De-planing was quick, and immigration and luggage collection super efficient, as is the norm at Changi. Overall this was a good flight, with excellent service measured against the standard of economy.

Leg from Sydney to Singapore the plane left on time, but what a disappointment the boarding process is, compared to Changi. The Boarding by Group No is a neat idea and works well at Changi, but Sydney is just the usual fare of Economy passengers standing in a massive queue trying to get on as quickly as possible and staff announcing the boarding by group, but not enforcing it. And the overhead screens showed Group 4 non-stop whilst they boarded other groups, whatever. Service on board was warm and welcoming, food was good but, surprisingly, even though it was announced, no immigration cards were handed out. When I asked, I was told they didn’t have any.

The first meal was a tasteless serve and the second one was of 3 Quiches (since when are quiches Indian meals?). And they were bad anyway. Furthermore, on the return trip, my wife received 3 oily and smelly Samosas. Who serves 3 samosas in one sitting? What is the chef thinking? 2) the staff while polite was not involved as they usually are. In my experience, Singapore Airlines makes a very conscious attempt to connect with travellers. They aim to make you as comfortable as possible, however, this time there was a non-commital attitude which was very unlike them. I had to ask for water more times then I can remember. Earlier it was always served in intervals because they were prompt. No feedback form was shared too. My child always receives some small talk with the staff and a little gift.

About 20 min later, one of the FA's served my the Thai chicken curry and rice. I was a bit shocked and told her that I requested breakfast, not supper, to which she replied they can serve only one meal to pax, and since I hadn't eaten this for supper, they brought it to me for breakfast. What? Only one meal in business class on a 13h 30m flight? And they say normal breakfast (you know toast, cereals and orange juice) is not available? Absolutely ridiculous. Not acceptable, especially in business class. Also, once they served supper (or breakfast), they went into the galley/crew rest area and never came out, and during the entire 13h 30m journey they did not even offer water to any of the pax.

The service has really gone downhill in the past 5 years. I was traveling with my 10 month old daughter and husband on the non-stop from Singapore to LA (round trip). The flight attendants don't pay attention to details. They say they will wash baby bottles, but they hand back the bottle with milk still in it. So I had to request to wash the bottles myself (thankfully they allowed this). We ordered the ""Book the Cook"" meals, but the flight attendant didn't look up our info so they tried to serve us regular meals. When I told them we ordered ""Book the Cook"" meals they asked us what we ordered. I couldn't remember. Between the two of us that's 8 meals on 2 different flights that I booked in advance. If I knew I had to bring confirmation of the meal request, I would have done that.  They heated up my daughter's meal without asking so it had to be thrown away because it needs to be consumed within one hour and she was sleeping because the flight was a night flight. The seats are uncomfortable for a 16 hour flight. I feel that economy plus seats for a long-haul flight should recline more. Also, the seats were really difficult for me to recline. When we boarded the plane, there was no bottled water in the water holders. Overall, it was just underwhelming. The price wasn't too bad considering it was Economy Plus and a non-stop flight to LA.

Brisbane to Singapore on the late night flight. Boarding was on time and proceeded smoothly, with the usual warm welcome from the cabin crew. The seating and space is good, as expected in premium economy, with ample locker space. The seats include a leg support which is ineffective, and the footrest is not very good. There are no pre-flight drinks, unlike other airlines premium economy, and the water bottles had not been put out into the holders. This seems to be a hit and miss affair, sometimes the bottles in place on boarding, and other times only handed out later. Having water available immediately at least compensates to some degree for the lack of pre-take off drinks. Drinks were served with the meal shortly after take off, and again the Singapore attitude to premium economy is apparent. Food is the same as economy served on plastic trays, with no linen or crockery. Drinks are served in plastic tumblers. SQ advertise champagne available throughout the flight, and serve a good quality champagne, but in a tiny plastic tumbler. Service starts in premium economy, but the same crew carry on through economy, and trays remain until service is complete, and no drink refills are offered in the meantime. Water bottles were eventually handed out after meal service. Singapore economy class service is probably the best in the world, and on this flight the crew were superb. Unfortunately they do not seem to be committed to premium economy, and the enhancements which are provided by their competitors are absent. The primary justification for the “premium” price is space and comfort, which is provided, but having paid a not insignificant premium on the fare the expectation of an improved service level does not seem unreasonable.

I dont know what happened to Singapore Airlines but just had my worst Economy flight ever. I am on the tall side with over 1.90cm but have had no issues on this flight over the decades on A310/A340/777/A330 in Eco and the occasional Biz class. My 1st time on their new A350-900 with their new economy seating and will be my last. The legroom is non existent.  My knees were in constant contact with the seat infront. If the person infront of you decides to recline then you get to enjoy the screen about 20cm from your face. The seats are an absolute nightmare. Not only is the pitch terrible but also the width which is a complete joke. If you are travelling with a family member then fine otherwise you get to enjoy constant shoulder rubbing with your neighbour. The seat padding is the hardest i have come across. Having flown Thai's A350-900 the weekend before to Bangkok in standard eco seat as well and having no issues, I was looking forward to the SQ experience. What an incredible let down that was. The Thai product is so much better which is something i would have thought I would never say when comparing to SQ. Even Emirates a few months before in Economy was an absolute joy in comparison. The inbound flight was a 23:10 departure and our dinner consisted of a beverage and a packet of peanuts before lights were turned off. 4 hours later breakfast was served which consisted of yoghurt, a bit of fruit, bread roll and flavourless noodles or omelette. Not being able to sleep, you had to play catch the crew walking past if you wanted water. Not being heavyset, the tray actually pushed into my stomach when folded out which was also a new experience. On the return leg I managed to get the extra legroom seat in row 55 which was fine legroom wise but it was even more narrow then the standard seat as the tray folds out of the armrest taking up width. Compared to the standard economy seat this one is bearable for the 7 hours but again, not for anything longer. Whilst boarding and scanning the ticket the ground staff in ADL remarked"" oh, I am glad you got that seat as you are tall"". Whilst on board and having settled into the seat, the steward's pre-empted my seat neighbour's and my comment with ""yeah i know, they are very narrow"" so I can imagine the number of complaints about their seats. My neighbour and I, whilst trying to avoid shoulder contact had a lengthy discussion about how terrible these SQ seats have become. I will be exploring other carriers and connections in future as the premium paid for Singapore Airlines is simply not there anymore. Reading the number of gripes on the web about their Biz seats as well, I will be sure to choose other carriers in the future which saddens me as have been flying Singapore Airlines my entire life and had them in the highest regard until now but wont be enduring this torture ever again.

This is probably the best thing about SingAir. Boarding is also a quick process. Most of the planes are a bit aged. Thus the screen or the audio jack may not work. The newer planes have better legroom. Although I always sneeze whenever I ride their planes, therefore the seats may not be disinfected regularly. They try to have a variety of dishes, but if you ride SingAir frequently, you will notice that the names of the dishes may change but the taste is just the same. I always like their salads. The crew do their job like clockwork, and that's about it just like an automatic clock. No personalised service, no understanding the needs of the passengers. I've been to a lot of flights with SingAir and you may have 1 or 2 passengers who can be a bit demanding and needy, but the rest are understanding. Frequent flyers know that they have a hundred and million things to do, but being an attendant is like a profession just like being a doctor who commits himself/herself to every patient under their care. That is the demand of the job. Lastly, it is very rare that SingAir flights are delayed, but in the rare occasions that they are, SingAir does not offer provisions for passengers who are inconvenienced by it. We don't need fancy hotels but maybe a space where we can relax other than the airport chairs or offer a massage or offer a meal or drink. Other airlines do that, why can't SingAir? Overall, SingAir is still a good airline if you are not very particular about things like the attendants being sensitive and aware that passengers are people that they should be taking care of or that the food tastes the same even though the names are different or hey don't offer anything to passengers who are inconvenienced with the delays.No personalised service",2019,09,23,checkin process always breeze probably best thing singair boarding also quick process planes bit aged thus screen audio jack may not work newer planes better legroom although always sneeze whenever ride planes therefore seats may not disinfected regularly try variety dishes but if ride singair frequently will notice names dishes may change but taste always like salads crew job like clockwork thats like automatic clock no personalised service no understanding needs passengers ive lot flights singair may passengers bit demanding needy but rest understanding frequent flyers know hundred million things but attendant like profession like doctor commits himselfherself every patient care demand job lastly rare singair flights delayed but rare occasions singair not offer provisions passengers inconvenienced dont need fancy hotels but maybe space relax airport chairs offer massage offer meal drink cant singair overall singair still good if not particular things like attendants sensitive aware passengers people taking care food tastes even though names different hey dont offer anything passengers inconvenienced delaysno personalised service,0.23124999999999996,1148,165

Very disappointed. The cabin service was fine, the flight was uneventful.

More than one phone call was made in a bid to secure a satisfactory response for this return and the outgoing flight on June 5. We ended up so far from where we wanted to be that the contempt I have for Airline Officials is significant. How on earth does an elderly infirm woman make her way to the back row when the walking device she uses is not allowed to come with her. I repeated many times that we would need an Aisle Chair, yet this was noticeably absent each time we boarded. Only after holding up the boarding, did an Aisle chair become available. I was so incensed after the first flight that I contacted SIA and told them what I really thought and their reaction for the return flight confirmed my long-held belief that this airline is only after my money and once that was in their possession - anything goes. Well I am not going to forget the battles I have had and the ignorance and contempt their administration has demonstrated on every occasion. They have lost me. The in-flight Service cannot override my sentiments. Do not bother if you are anything but a passenger who is happy to hand over your money and accept great service when your basic requests are treated so poorly. The Admin team is inept and say ""Yes"" to every request yet failed to deliver. The cabin crew could not believe the admin ignored me until I showed them the emails.

Incredibly inept Admin. I spent time establishing parameters for which my elderly mother could get a seat close to the lavatory and after many calls direct to Singapore I had confirmation that the range of seats we would get was limited but acceptable. I got this in an email. At boarding, it became clear the layout for our flight was vastly different to that which had been shown previously. She was as far from the lavatory as she could be. Other passengers could not pass us in the aisle and the journey to the lavatory took 10 minutes with the turbulence we encountered. No aisle seats was available in Business class despite a prior agreement that one would be aboard. I may as well have not bothered dealing with the airline. That SIA failed to deliver on this flight and the ensuing return later, shows the customer what the airline think of even their Business Class passengers - absolutely nothing.

The aircraft, being 15 days old at the time of flying, had a fast touchscreen monitor. The toilets were stocked with free amenities, including toothbrush and toothpaste. Crew took my order first, food choices sweet and sour pork or steamed fish. I chose the pork, was so delicious.  Delicious Turkish pide, couscous salad, and bread roll. I was also given an activity pack (although really not for my age still a nice touch), which featured a deck of cards and some crayons.

A worry when I had all our passports etc in one of the bags as on take-off we could not have a bag near us and no seats to put it under. My major complaint is that as we were the first row after the Premium compartment and when meals etc were served they were served from the other end of the plane - we were last to be served. No offer of pre-dinner drinks (I had to get up and ask the crew after our meals were served). We had no choice in dinner we had what was left! Chicken! At breakfast the same happened all there was left was noodles and beef. I said to the crew I would like the scrambled egg please and he said it had all gone. I said I did not want noodles for breakfast so off he went and minutes later he brought scrambled egg dish. They forgot my husband and after 10 minutes they came with a breakfast meal.

Priority boarding after business class allows time to settle in, with ample space in the overhead lockers. Just three rows in the cabin, with good legroom and comfortable seats, which have a decent recline. There is a footrest on the seat in front, and a calf rest attached to the seat, which seems to serve no purpose other than create problems for the crew in trying to them stowed for landing. Good sized TV screen which is easy to operate. Overall the hard product is good. However there is nothing premium about the service, which is strictly economy. There are no pre take-off drinks, and there was no bar service after take-off prior to the meal. This may have been due to the late hours departure and a wish to serve the meal as quickly as possible, but one would have thought that with a maximum of 24 in premium economy this would not have been a big issue. Amenity kits are no longer handed out, but the menu indicated they were available on request. Meals were tasty, but the same as economy, served on plastic trays. No sign of table cloths and proper crockery as shown on the website. Drinks are served in plastic as opposed to glasses, and in small quantities. Wine was a basic white or red in a small plastic tumbler half filled. Fruit juice slightly larger serving, but still meagre. No offers of refills until the trays were eventually removed. There are no dedicated crew in premium economy. Service starts with premium, but then proceeds through economy, with clearing starting at the back of economy, so that premium economy is the last to be cleared. With the time difference the second meal was lunch. This time I ordered champagne, served in a plastic stemmed “glass” amounting to half a normal glass, again no refills offered until trays cleared, at which time the champagne had disappeared from the trolly. The main reason for choosing premium economy is space and comfort, on which there are no complaints. However notwithstanding the fact that Singapore economy is amongst the best, it is not a premium economy service.

In the past 10 year or so, we can clearly see many once premium airlines in the world have to resort to cost cutting, due to keen competition from low cost carriers and many other factors. Haven't not been on economy class of Singapore for quite some time, I decided to try it for it's a short haul flight plus it's price factor was very good this time. The usual high standard of SIA is there with the immaculately groomed kebaya-clad crew, and the good condition of the plane and its amenities etc. Hot towel service is still provided in economy class which is a nice touch. Menu is not given since it's a short sector. Hot drinks, cold beverages and meals are all served in one go, which cuts time and makes good sense. However, one can clearly see some cost cutting with the portion of the meal smaller, and the taste was rather bland and mediocre. Boeing 787 on the way to BKK was a fine plane, except the seat pitch and the aisle are all very narrow. Sat at the aisle, I was constantly bumped by the crew and passengers, there's almost nowhere foe me to hide as I wild be spilling onto my neighbour's space. It's quite frustrating really. Also the tray table is so close to my stomach, it's uncomfortable to say the least. Touch screen AVOD was very good, and pre-ordered duty free was dully delivered without delay. On return, SIA has a good lounge on concourse D of BKK airport, which is very close to the boarding gate, D6 or 7. A330, despite being an older plane, actually offered more seat pitch and slightly more space. No touch screen this time. The catering from BKK was better than from SIN.

After making the booking which included a code share arrangement for 2 adults with an infant, everything started well with a bassinet being requested. From that point I had to call at least four times with apparent issues with the names on itinerary even though they were correct from the outset. This issue arises again upon attempting online check in which wasn’t at all possible because one adults name was somehow written in twice, once as a Mr and one as a Mrs. called and requested a business class upgrade. Was told due to code share it wasn’t possible (hello I’m trying to give you my money)! Thereafter we arrived at the airport to a very rude staff member once again telling me the names were incorrect in the system, even though the night before I had the itinerary emailed to me from Singapore airlines customer call centre showing correct details, after the initial attempt to check in failed, which confirmed names were correct, I showed this document as proof, lady appeared uninterested. codeshare 2nd leg of journey had tickets produced at Melbourne airport by Singapore staff and after being flustered by this to and fro at check in I didn’t bother to check the seat allocation for the 2nd leg which didn’t have bassinet allocation. To our horror we discovered the Singapore Airlines check in lady had allocated us seats in different rows on opposite sides of the plane with a one year old! How can they be so unprofessional? The worst part, when transiting through SIN I approached the transfer counter of the codeshare airline, which is Singapore’s budget carrier Scoot and this helpful assistant was able to pair us together, making the MEL - SIN Singapore employees actions even worse. To top it off the flight wasn’t full, but also we cannot purchase additional baggage online due to once again the codeshare arrangement and furthermore we arrive at our final destination and discovered both our suitcases were broken with the wheels coming off before we exited the airport. Having flown many major international airlines overseas, I will never fly with Singapore again. It’s an indictment on Singapore Airlines that the service and experience on the 2nd leg operated by Scoot overall in SIN airport and on board was far superior to the Singapore airlines journey to SIN. If going Australia to Europe, I highly recommend you consider a Middle East airline that shows accountability and pride in their responsibility to fare paying passengers.

As the seats are very closed, we would have preferred to sit all in one row, so we asked at Check In to be seated in one row, either 19 or 20. They told us it was fully Business Class, but they will leave a note and we can check at the Gate. We did, but the passengers on the window seats did not want to move, which was OK to us as they have been faster than us, so it is OK. Upon closing of the doors, we saw that Seat 20K was free, so I asked the flight attendant if my wife can move then from 19F, so we can sit in one row. She said this is a cockpit seat and she needs to check with the pilot. Upon departure she came back and told us that the pilot does not want to change the seat to 19F or 21K. Really?

I was looking forward to flying Singapore Airlines and their new B787-10. I had set my expectations at the same level as Qatar Airways, seeing the fact that they are both 5-star airlines. With this in mind, I would firstly like to say that I was not impressed with Singapore Airlines, as they were quite inconsistent across the categories. The website is user-friendly, but I did encounter some glitches. Online check in is slightly confusing but I was able to manage. We arrived at Bangkok Airport 3.15 hours before our flight, and the check in counters opened 2.45 hours before the flight. It was extremely confusing which line is for which passenger, as they separate Business and Gold into different lines. In the end we were very quickly checked in at the gold counter. Luckily at that time of day security and immigration moved quickly. The Silverkris lounge in Bangkok is in a word, exquisite. The decor is very fancy and there is a manned bar with a barista making craft drinks and all sorts of coffee. Seats were plenty, clean and even the toilets are cleaned after every use! The breakfast buffet was slightly disappointing, but I have come to expect that with all airlines. Boarding was extremely confusing, they asked gold members to queue up with business class but the sign asks them to queue up at the economy door. Not only that, they board business class passengers first then gold members, which makes a mess! Other Star Alliance carriers just board gold and business at the same time. Hassle free! I received a warm welcome at the door, and found my seat. The flight attendant was even kind enough to help my mum lift her suitcase into the overhead compartment! I would never expect a flight attendant to do it out of the blue! The seat was, in a word, horrible. It was so narrow! Qatar Airways also has 3-3-3 seating on their 787s, but it wasn't this narrow. I'm slightly large, but even my rather small mum sat shoulder-to-shoulder with the other passenger in the window seat! Legroom was fine. What I don't get is that these aircraft with small seats are being deployed on flights as far as Brisbane, an 8 hour hop. However, the bad seat was overshadowed by the service. On my outbound flight from Bangkok, I chose a seafood meal and got the same thing I get all the time flying Star Alliance out of Bangkok, mixed grilled seafood served with tomatoes, peas and duchess potatoes. The catering was provided by Thai Airways, and even had the Thai Airways logo on it. Needless to say, it was very nice. On my return flight, when coming around for drinks, the lovely flight attendant noticed me checking the white wine bottle to see what it was, and I love the way she asked if I wanted the Sauvignon Blanc rather than""white wine.  The crew on Singapore Airlines are fantastic, and very hardworking. Entertainment was adequate, I wouldn't be bored even on the longest flight. On the return flight, we checked in 7 hours before departure time as we wanted to explore Jewel. Absolutely recommended. The gold lounge in Terminal 2 was an absolute disappointment! Even the Thai Airways lounge in T1 is better! Other than that, this flight was almost identical, except for some very strong turbulence. Overall, Singapore Airlines is a good choice. If they can improve their seat and value their star gold more, I would be a returning customer.The seat was in a word, horrible",2019,07,04,bangkok looking forward flying new set expectations level qatar airways seeing fact mind would firstly like say not impressed quite inconsistent across categories website userfriendly but encounter glitches online check slightly confusing but able manage arrived bangkok airport hours check counters opened hours extremely confusing line passenger separate business gold different lines end quickly checked gold counter luckily time day security immigration moved quickly silverkris lounge bangkok word exquisite decor fancy manned bar barista making craft drinks sorts coffee seats plenty clean even toilets cleaned every use breakfast buffet slightly disappointing but come expect boarding extremely confusing asked gold members queue business class but sign asks queue economy door not board business class passengers first gold members makes mess star alliance carriers board gold business time hassle free received warm welcome door found seat attendant even kind enough help mum lift suitcase overhead compartment would never expect attendant blue seat word horrible narrow qatar airways also seating but wasnt narrow im slightly large but even rather small mum sat shouldertoshoulder passenger window seat legroom fine dont get aircraft small seats deployed flights far brisbane hour hop however bad seat overshadowed service outbound bangkok chose seafood meal got thing get time flying star alliance bangkok mixed grilled seafood served tomatoes peas duchess potatoes catering provided thai airways even thai airways logo needless say nice return coming around drinks lovely attendant noticed checking white wine bottle see love way asked if wanted sauvignon blanc rather thanwhite wine crew fantastic hardworking entertainment adequate wouldnt bored even longest return checked hours departure time wanted explore jewel absolutely recommended gold lounge terminal absolute disappointment even thai airways lounge better almost identical except strong turbulence overall good choice if improve seat value star gold would returning customerthe seat word horrible,0.0828558696205755,2070,294

What a disappointing flight. Probably the worst crew I ever had, very inattentive. It was very hard to get any attention at all (the attendant button at your seat was completely useless, no reaction by the crew whatsoever) I had 2 drinks in a 12 hour flight. I wasn't asked for a drink with our meals and the meals unfortunately didn't save the day either. Most of the time we had to queue at the lavatory (the layout of the plane for PE is horrible), because the 2 lavatories were used by Economy as well. The lavatory situation in Economy was much better, nobody surely had to queue there (11 lavatories according to the seat map!). It didn't help that a family with two toddlers and a crying baby was sitting in the same row. On the positive side were the headphones (even if they had to replace my headphones straightaway) and the entertainment system. Avoid booking Premium Economy with Singapore Air, you have a better deal in Economy (or Business of course). Another weird point was that Economy class was disembarking before Premium Economy, another novelty for me.

We had really been looking forward to the new A359 taking over from the old 777 on the Christchurch to Singapore route with the choice of premium economy. Unfortunately, the bean counters seem to have designed the cabin! The configuration is 2x4x2 — just one seat less than economy — compared with 2x3x2 for Lufthansa in premium economy in the same type of aircraft, which we enjoyed for the next leg of our trip to Europe. The lavatories are the size of a small cupboard and there is no space to get up and stretch your legs in the cabin, unlike earlier aircraft. Going over was OK in the two seats by the window, but as others have pointed out, the central armrest and padded seatbelt (it contains an airbag) intrude on space. Inflight food and service was fine, if not memorable. Coming back overnight stuck in the middle seats was a lot worse. Space feels very tight. Not all menu choices were available, and we got beef mince, which was not very good at all. We asked for eggs for breakfast but got yam cake. A gentleman two seats along turned on his overhead lamp at about 3:00 am (he should have used the reading lamp). No eyeshades or earplugs provided. We asked for some but still got no sleep. Screens didn't work for two of the passengers in front of us. This flight ended up being diverted because of fog, adding six hours to the nine hour flight (of course, not SIA’s fault) but the whole experience was very tiring. One other thing: Electronic check-in at Changi was confusing and everyone had to ask what step to do next. It should be much clearer. We have flown with SIA for 35 years and feel they are trading on their past good reputation and really need to lift their game. Premium economy on SIA really isn’t worth the extra cost. It doesn’t feel special at all.

The Business lounge in Changi is OK, but nothing to write home about. We ordered ' book the cook' option, one chicken Brest and one Steak dish. Upon boarding we were greeted by a very cheerful crew, the flight manager already knew my name without looking at any list. The seat was incredibly wide,but quite hard in my opinion. My tail bone tells me immediately, as I was injured in a ski accident, and I can't sit in a regular economy seat more than 2 hours. I was a bit disappointed, as Aeroflot  Business seat from Moscow to Shanghai was much softer and pampering. After take off I went to the bathroom, and upon my return I found the satay dish awaiting me. I only enjoyed the chicken stick. Then no service for almost 45 min, without one cabin staff in sight .Slowly the magic and excitement were wearing off. Eventually one  showed up and asked me if I didn't like it. I said I only liked the chicken and she offered me some more, nice gesture, but I declined. There were maybe 15 passengers in Business class,that I believe can fit 50-60 passengers. Not a tough flight for the crew. Then came a green salad, very average,and then my book the cook meal showed up, which was good. As I like to drink with my main meal, and my glass was almost empty, as it Lasted me through the salad and the Satay, it was time to refresh my glass,but not such offer. I buzzed the cabin crew,and asked for another glass of drink. I kept enjoying my meal awaiting my drink that never showed up. I buzzed the crew again,and this time the flight manager showed up, I asked to have my drink if possible with my meal not with the dessert. The Coke showed up in 5 seconds. Then came the dessert, a dish with Ice cream, no choices, and a Fruit basket, the most basic desert cart I ever saw. At that point I was already regretting the huge amount of money invested in trying to experience the top notch Business class.  Then I wanted to rest,but the crew must turn your seat upside down, very weird idea,and even with the thin mattress ,it was far from a pampering bed.IF you feel like sitting down again,you have to call the F/A to flip it over to a seat..Personaly I prefer control of my lying situation, rather than calling the FA. No amenity kit distributed, but I heard that they pass by with a choice of amenities that you may find necessary for your trip -  no such basket was offered. My 14 yo son told me after the meal that he still felt hungry. I called his flight attendant  who seemed amused by my statement and said she will 'take care of him' - she brought him a small pack of nuts. So much for generosity. At Aeroflot, upon hearing that my son was still hungry (growing boy,) brought him a pasta casserole from Business class. Free WiFi to Business class was a great idea.

Having flown with Singapore before I was sure that they would be helpful and accomodating as we flew with our 5 month old to visit family at Christmas. We checked in the pram and car seat after paying to have them wrapped at the airport and had arranged to have a bassinet seat for the flight. This was all arranged with no problems. However, around an hour into the flight I was very aware that my baby needed to be changed. I went to queue for the toilets and there was 6 people ahead of me in the queue. My baby began to scream, I’m sure to the discomfort of the other passengers. I was very aware of this and decided to try and find another bathroom with a smaller queue. The only one with no queue and a change table was in business class. As I approached, one of the cabin staff asked where I was going. I said “sorry, my baby is screaming I just need to change her” she said “you can’t use these toilets you have to go back” I explained the queue situation but she wouldn’t budge so I had to go and queue with my child screaming and all the other passengers glaring at me. When we arrived at Perth airport we were annoyed to find that out pram was broken. Despite having it wrapped, it had been broken through the wrapping and the footrest was hanging off despite the fact we had only had it for 5 months. I checked the airline policies which stated we were covered up to a certain amount so I emailed them within 48 hours with the relevant forms, photos of damage, boarding passes and purchase receipts. They responded after a few days with a very unprofessional email basically requesting the same information I had already sent. I sent it again. Twice. They sent another badly worded email asking me to drop it off somewhere for assessment. By this point we had been back with our taped up pram for about two weeks. I responded explaining that it’s the only pram we have and we couldn’t drop it off. We had done everything they had asked. I never heard anything back. We were very disappointed and annoyed with the way we were treated both on the flight and the way our complaint was dealt with.

For my holiday to New Zealand in February / March this year I decided to upgrade my flights for all four legs of the journey to business class. Three parts of my journey were enjoyable, the service and food was good, even though I didn't receive the book the cook meals Id ordered. Sadly on the last leg from Singapore to London flight SQ322 I found myself on the A380-800. I found the business class section to be cramped, with a lack of storage space, not very well designed and for a new plane starting to show signs of wear and tear. The first problem was the width of the seat, it was a lot narrower than other seats in business class. I heard a lady behind me complaining to a stewardess about the hard seat. She replied that BMW had designed it. My thought was what is comfortable in a sports car is not so good on a 13-15 hour flight where you are sitting / lying down for nearly all the time. However with cushions it can be made more comfortable. Nothing can be done to make the seat wider and the high and very wide plastic infill between my seat and the window made me feel more cramped. I could see no useful purpose for it. The lack of storage space was a problem. I didn't want to put my carry on bag in the overhead lockers as it could be difficult / noisy to access it on a night flight. Unlike some other planes there was no small recess area where I could put my bag on the floor, but within my seating area, so the aisle was still clear. A stewardess put it on the floor but when the bed was out I couldn't access it without grovelling about on the floor. I made my bed up and tried to sleep. I placed my handbag on top of the large but fairly useless plastic infill, during the flight I think as a result of turbulence the bag fell on my head. I wasn't impressed at the time but later on I did see the funny side of it. As the seat / bed was narrow when I turned over I kept hitting my head. It was also quite difficult to get up from. I've had no such difficulties on other business class flights . The design, space and attractiveness is so much better on other Singapore Airlines business class cabins. I know the other passengers in my group flying in business on this flight were unhappy too. While I was queuing to leave the plane at the end of the flight a man of average height and regular weight said That thing is a waste of space refering to the plastic infill between the seat and the window. I had to agree. A senior stewardess told me the airline is planning to convert more of their planes to this design. Thanks for the warning. When I fly to Australia next year I will have to look for a new provider.

I have flown Singapore Airlines from the past 20 years regularly until now, I considered myself to be a loyal customers. They used to care about customers before; apparently, being named the best airline in the world has gone to their head and they think they no longer have to satisfy their customers. I flew Premium economy recently to Bangalore and paid for the extra legroom seat--the flight was ordinary. I was expecting an offer to upgrade to business class before my flight and I have more than 50,000 pts. No such offer came--I tried to offer a bid, the system didn't allow me to. When I saw the flight, there were plenty of seats empty in Business class. Not sure why they don't want to offer the premium economy passengers to upgrade to business. Warning to everyone travelling from SFO--some connections to India have a very short layover--less than an hour. SA doesn't have any consideration that if the landing is a few minutes late and the connecting flight is within 30 minutes, they shouldn't make the passenger run from one terminal to another even using Skytrain. I barely made it before the gate closed (with my bad knees). Remember, you have to go through security in Singapore when you have a connecting flight. I had to rush from Terminal B to C with no time even to rush to the restroom let alone freshen up.  While returning from Bangalore, I had ~4 kgs extra. Instead of asking me to pay using my Krisflyer (over 50,000) points, Singapore airlines charged me for a whole extra piece. So watch out, even if you are just 2-4 kgs over the limit in Premium economy, they will charge the cost of a suitcase. I even asked to pay for the upgrade in Bangalore, the said I can't do it in the last minute using points and I should check during my layover in Singapore (~ 2 hours). When I tried to upgrade for the longer flight SIN - SFO, they said that I don't have enough points. I offered to pay with points and cash--they said I can't do that. They just didn't want me in Business class even with points or cash! I wanted to avoid paying extra weight fees as I would have below the limit int Business class. If this is not an example of not caring for customers or accommodating its Krisflyer members, I don't know what is. Why can't they charge per Kg extra weight instead of an additional piece of luggage like other airlines?   Flight and food was ordinary (food quality has declined from SF to Singapore), and the bathroom cleanliness both ways was not up to par like it used to be. Changi airport is exceptional of course. I am not sure I will  be flying this airline again while there are so many carriers who offer upgrades for a reasonable price and cheaper tickets. Not sure what to do with the balance points (more than 50,000 points) though.

We booked a flight to SIN on Singapore Airlines in economy class from LAX for 11/2018. A few days before we departed, we received an email from them encouraging us to bid on an upgrade to economy plus. Even indicated what was a “low” bid with less chance of getting the upgrade, so we paid a higher bid that gave us a “fair” chance. Shortly before our flight we received an email that we were approved and could book our seats. We immediately went to the seat selections and found only 4 seats available, none together or even close. We called Singapore Airlines but they said there was nothing available and our prior seats in economy were now taken. We again asked at the counter when we checked in but same answer - no seats available. We are in our 70’s and had to sit rows apart on different sides of the aircraft for this very long flight. One of the seats was in the last row of economy plus and was so cramped it was very difficult to get in and out to use the restroom. We suffered. When we returned home, we found out Singapore Airlines would not even give miles for the flight since it was initially booked in economy. We requested our money back as we felt taken and deceived with the charge, lack of disclosure, and the unacceptable and poor quality service provided.

In Tokyo Haneda, check in was very efficient, despite it being a full flight (perhaps as many wanted to return home for Christmas), and boarding was very fast too, although the managing could have been better as I witnessed some passengers holding only an economy class ticket using the business class queue. Despite the inclement weather, the flight took off very quickly, and after we left Tokyo the flight was smooth throughout. Aircraft wise, the A350 had always been a comfortable aircraft, and this was no exception - the product offered was very comfortable, and the legroom was good even in economy class. The cabin crew was also very warm and friendly and attentive to every passenger. After meal service was concluded the lights were dimmed to allow the passengers to sleep, as it was a night flight. The IFE was touchscreen, just like my previous flight with SQ on their 787 and very responsive, no problems encountered. The only downside was that SQ did not implement a tail camera that can be broadcast on the IFE - a pity, considering that the A350 has the technology and other A350 users such as Cathay Pacific and Thai Airways are using them. Not an important feature, but it would have been really cool to see it. I picked the Japanese selection for my meal, and it was very good.

Early morning departure from SIN at Chinese New Year, so it was a pretty full flight. Just after security check and with less than one hour to departure, we were told that there was a technical problem with the plane and we needed to switch plane (different gate). Amazingly, the entire flight was only delayed by 1 hour, which given the short notice, I feel is pretty amazing. Flight was on A330, which has the 2-4-2 configuration, and as usual, I opted for the (2) seat which I increasingly like. Seats were slightly narrower than the B777, but it just feels less cramped than the 3 seat options. Flight crew were slightly less charming than usual, but I guess the last minute change probably had something to do with this, and they still dealt very politely with some very demanding customers. Food was reasonably good (had Indonesian option), and IFE was as standard on the A330, if slightly dated. Only slight downside was the toilet, which although clean, had obviously seen better days with some wear and tear. So a good economy experience and I guess the additional cost for the flight (as opposed to the budget airline) pays off when something does wrong, as the recovery was really fast.a good economy experience",2019,02,25,denpasar bali early morning departure sin chinese new year pretty full security check less one hour departure told technical problem needed switch different gate amazingly entire delayed hour given short notice feel pretty amazing configuration usual opted seat increasingly like seats slightly narrower but feels less cramped seat options crew slightly less charming usual but guess last minute change probably something still dealt politely demanding customers food reasonably good indonesian option ife standard if slightly dated slight downside toilet although clean obviously seen better days wear tear good economy experience guess additional cost opposed budget pays off something wrong recovery really fasta good economy experience,0.1135386119257087,739,105

Having experienced United's version of the B787, this was an opportunity to revisit the experience on SQ instead on a short 2.5 hour flight. The initial entrance into the economy cabin is certainly more welcoming than United's experience. Once seated, you notice the high-density, thin seat cushions, which give you more perceived legroom than the standard 32 in pitch would suggest. Because SQ stayed with the 3-3-3 configuration, the seat width is narrower than the comparable A330 or B777 experience, and I certainly felt this was the case, despite the very narrow armrests. Certainly the aisles are narrow, and in the aisle seat, I was constantly jostled by passengers and assorted bags during the boarding process. I also found it hard to get comfortable on the thinner seats, though this was less of an issue for a short-haul flight. The IFE was a class above United's, with a large vibrant touchscreen and the newest KrisWorld experience (minus the seat controller), so all interactions are via the screen. Meals were reasonably good if not outstanding, while service on the inbound flight to SG was warm and friendly.

London to Bali via Singapore. I flew to Australia with Singapore Airlines 5 years ago and the service was out of this world, amazing. I flew last October with them to Bali and back and it seems that standards have slipped. It seems there are a lot more male stewards on board now and they seem to give worse service than the female stewardesses. Male stewards seemed disorganised, flustered and abrupt compared to the female stewardesses who were very organised and polite.  The airline needs to have standard procedures that staff follow. We had an issue with my partners meal being vegetarian nut free and Singapore Airlines were less than helpful. They served him nuts and or meat in a few of his meals, luckily he didn't eat them. When we told cabin crew that he was supposed to have been served a nut free vegetarian meal they said we never would have been promised such a thing because it didn't exist. When we showed proof of Singapore Airlines emails promising us a nut-free vegetarian meal the steward seemed disgruntled that we had proved we weren't lying about it all. A female stewardess found something my partner could eat. Pluses: Female members of staff = fab. Clean and comfy aircraft. Pretty decent snacks and entertainment.

Singapore to Zurich is operated by an A380. This particular A380 that I was on is 6 years old and had the old business class product. The seat is very wide - the widest Business Class seat for any airline - sufficient to squeeze 2 slim Asians into the seat. To convert to bed mode, passengers had to pull down the seat back and raise the footrest. Because the footwell is located to one side, passengers have to sleep in a diagonal fashion. I ordered the lobster thermidor from Book the Cook. It was delicious. Cabin crew were very friendly and polite and addressed passengers by family name. After supper, it was time to sleep. A flight attendant deployed the bed for me and I had an uninterrupted 7 hours of sleep before breakfast. For breakfast I chose the Nasi Briyani, an aromatic Indian dish.

The air hostesses are usually very service minded in Singapore Airlines and thats why I used to like them. But the exception is this flight through Russia. The air hostesses are mainly Russian and do not meet expectations in my eyes of the usual level of service that defines this airline. Furthermore, when exiting the plane in Moscow, prepare yourself for a nightmare. 1 long line which consists of all the passengers on the A350-900, needs to line up for getting a red stamp in your boarding pass. Then you have to stand in a second long line to get a green stamp in your boarding pass. Then there was a third line to the x-ray of the hand luggage before you could stand (not enough seats to sit) by the gate without any restaurant, café or what so ever. And add to the misery that since i stupidly enough forgot my boarding pass to Moscow on the plane, I had to stand in a fourth line. Its very obvious this route is a failure.

Ample overhead luggage space. Leg space a bit tight. Seat reclination juts the backseat TV screen rather close to your face and the tray table to your tummy. In fact, the flight attendants, while serving meals, ensured that the passengers returned the seats to a more straight up position. A dinner and a breakfast were served. A multi page menu book was provided to all. There were two entree choices for both meals - no vegetarian choice. That was a shocking surprise. I chose the fish dish. It was amply portioned and tasty. The breakfast cold sandwiches were dry and virtually inedible. Predinner drinks were served in plastic tumblers from a tray that flight attendants carried - juice, beer, white wine were on offer. Dinner and breakfast cutlery were metal, not plastic. Duty free catalog was thick but nothing distinctive products on offer. Cockpit crew kept us informed of the flight and take off delays. Singapore Airlines should consider their impact on the environment - on this relatively short overnight flight they can simplify the breakfast and dinner, dispense with the paper menu and the basic amenities bag and ensure a vegetarian option as standard.

Took the front row bulkhead seat in PE on Boeing 777-300ER which gives quite a lot of legroom, the downside is the the inflight entertainment (IFE) system is tucked away on the floor, in a it's own separate housing. I eschewed the champagne and dinner for sleep, and here I still find the SQ PE seats very stiff and difficult to recline, it really takes quite a lot of effort to force the seat into a recline position. Nonetheless, there is a reasonable amount of elbow space, and the personal reading lights, noise-cancelling earphones and cubby holes give a sense of comfort. The IFE is the new touch-screen system with a separate seat controller handset. My IFE monitor refused to come out of it's housing, but the aircrew performed some magic with a knife and fork, and saved the day! Food (the breakfast that I tried) was reasonably good, and crew were proactive with drinks and snacks through the flight. The only downside of PE in the B777 series is that access to the shared toilets is at the rear with normal economy, and you have to manage the queues for access the best you can.

They came to serve my 8 year old Sister the meal however they did not give her two choices to choose from. They just served my Sister chicken with rice. It turns out that the chicken with rice was too spicy. There were actually two choices (beef stew and chicken with rice) which left me wondering why they did not stop to ask my Sister what choice she wanted. They didn’t even tell her that the chicken with rice was spicy!  When the cabin crew came round to serve adults, they were very rushed and did not make themselves clear at all. They asked ‘stew or chicken rice?’. They didn’t bother to tell us what meat the stew was. And they also did not offer any drinks. You have to ask them yourselves. The service I experienced was far from the ‘superior quality’ Singapore Airlines used to offer. I understand the need to rush service a little as the flight was only a little over two hours. However that does not mean that they can treat passengers like that. Disappointed with Singapore Airlines this time round.

We were 30 minutes late, and it seems that this is the norm for this flight, and an extra half hour of sitting around at the time in the morning is frustrating. Boarding when started was efficient. The premium economy cabin is relatively spacious with ample space for storage, and the seats are very comfortable. A pre-take off drink, as is the norm on other airlines premium economy would have been very welcome after the wait. After take off drinks were served. Champagne is offered, but in a tiny plastic faux wine glass, and other drinks are also served in plastic tumblers that seem to become progressively smaller. Due to the timing only a light snack is offered. Although this was quick there was a long wait for coffee or drinks top up to be offered, and tables cleared, as there are no dedicated premium economy crew. Service is the same as economy, and although Singapore Airlines economy is amongst the best it does not match the premium economy service of other airlines such as Qantas.

Even though I understand that the ground staff are mostly outsourced, they are representing SQ, so I should expect professional service. The aircraft from SIN to HKG was very old that the screen is still is squared format. The meal tasted bad as well.

Singapore Airlines is my best economy flight experiences so far. When I arrived at Hong Kong airport, I mentioned to the ground crew doing my check-in that I was concerned about any delay as I only had 3 hours of layover at London Heathrow when I had to clear customs and wait for my checked bag before I travel from terminal 2 to terminal 5 to catch the BA flight to Leeds. She called someone and then went to ask her superior when she couldn’t get answer on the phone to see if it’s possible to check my bag to Leeds. I knew they couldn’t do that when the two airlines belong to different airline partnerships (One World for BA and Star Alliance for SQ).  When I came back to Hong Kong a week later, I asked the ground crew at check-in if they might have any row of 3-seaters available,  ground crew looked to see if two rows that were blocked could be released. She then assigned the aisle seat, blocked the middle seat, and said she would do her best not to assign anyone to the window seat if possible.  I was able to lie down from London to Singapore. When they served the main meal, I told a flight attendant that I wanted Peppermint tea  and I brought my own as other airlines I have flown never had peppermint tea. He said they did. Not only did he bring me a cup, he also gave me a few bags of them for my layover at the Singapore airport. SQ has the most comfortable pillow for economy class in my experience. The blanket was twice the size and thicker than that of United. The economy passengers also got an amenitY kit (socks, toothbrush, toothpaste) .

There are no pre- take off drinks, and although champagne is offered when drinks are served after take off, it is in a tiny plastic faux wine glass. Wine is of mediocre quality served in a plastic tumbler. Top ups are a long time in coming as there are no dedicated premium economy crew, and the same staff serve the economy cabin.

Check in and boarding could not be criticized, effortless and quick, with smiling welcoming staff. The premium economy cabin is very pleasant, with lots of locker space, and the seats are comfortable, with good recline and ample leg room. For a daylight flight the entertainment system is paramount, and this is top notch with a 13 inch hadscreen, superb noise cancelling headphones, and a vast selection of programmers. However when it comes to service, standards drop to economy level. No pre-take off drink, nor after take off drinks. A 1 hour wait until meal service, when drinks are served with the meal. Champagne is available, but wines are mediocre and served in plastic tumblers. The last time we flew this route in economy there was at least a proper glass on the tray, but now it is all plastic. Meals were brunch and then a hot snack later, with a choice of two dishes on each occasion, but out of both meals only the ice cream was good. During the flight the crew were very active, with frequent drink runs, and washrooms were well maintained. Overall a very comfortable flight, with an excellent crew, but a level of service not up to expectations for premium economy.a very comfortable flight",2018,09,09,brisbane flown route several times previously flying economy introduction looking forward daylight premium economy check boarding could not criticized effortless quick smiling welcoming staff premium economy cabin pleasant lots locker space seats comfortable good recline ample leg room daylight entertainment system paramount top notch inch hadscreen superb noise cancelling headphones vast selection programmers however comes service standards drop economy level no pretake off drink nor take off drinks hour wait meal service drinks served meal champagne available but wines mediocre served plastic tumblers last time flew route economy least proper glass tray but plastic meals brunch hot snack later choice two dishes occasion but meals ice cream good crew active frequent drink runs washrooms well maintained overall comfortable excellent crew but level service not expectations premium economya comfortable,0.2528985507246377,913,128

First off, the seats were angled weird and made it difficult to sleep comfortably. The entertainment remote was also not very responsive. There were way too many announcements causing frequent interruptions in watching movies (and don't tell me they are necessary as I've never experienced so many announcements on any other airlines). I booked the cook for all my flight meals when it was available. On none of the flights were any of the flight attendants aware that I had pre-ordered my meals. They always asked me what I wanted to order and I had to remind them that I had booked the cook.  On my last leg back home (Seoul to LAX), same problem occurred, but this time they forgot to serve me breakfast (despite being awoken almost 4 hours before landing). They served me the preliminary stuff but then I sat for another hour with no meal served. I went up to one of the flight attendants, and she notified me that she accidentally gave my pre-ordered meal to someone else. However, 10 minutes later, she came out with my correct meal, which tells me she simply just forgot to serve me. The head flight attendant was apologetic and offered me a 100 Singapore Dollar voucher to use on in flight shopping. He told me it was good for one year, but I have no idea if I am going to take another Singapore Airlines flight within the next year, and especially not after this poor experience.

The legroom on the flight was superb due I was seated at the emergency exit. Unfortunately the IFE was only on overhead screens, so it was quite boring flight. After the layover in Singapore, the ground handling for the 2nd leg was very good and boarding commenced with only slight delay. The service on this flight began shortly after takeoff, but it was a bit rushed during late dinner was served, and I didn't get the dessert. But since it was an ample and tasty dinner, I didn't mind at all since it was already 2am as well. The selection on IFE was superb, but the flight information is a bit outdated, since it was a non-refurbished aircraft. After I called FA for a mid-term snack an ample snack was served.

Flying Premium Economy was disappointing, over rated seating and food was average and similar to Economy - apart from slight extra leg room, it was not premium at all. Service was below average. Transit in Singapore was also disappointing as agreed requests to ground staff were not actioned on aircraft. After a long time, am using my KrisFlyer points for my wife to travel Business Class from Melbourne to Rome via Singapore on in August 2018 whilst I am travelling on a Business Class ticket. My wife’s SIN-ROME booking using KrisFlyer points remains waitlisted on Business Saver Class despite 3 months of booking. Instead, Singapore Airlines wishes me to pay approx AUD$1,500 to upgrade my wife’s Business Saver Class to the next sub-class. This is unacceptable and disappointing.  Despite being a loyal customer for over 30 years, a fair significant of which is as a PPS member until recently, the airline is unable to assist. Based on poor treatment to-date in respect of item 3 above, it appears that Singapore Airlines is misleading with its KrisFlyer program in that passengers are encouraged to join up but the ability to redeem points is difficult/a very long wait. redeem points is difficult

Check in was fantastic as I was able to use the first class check in in Singapore which is a pleasant experience. Silver Kris first class lounge is in need of renovation as it is not in line with today’s standards of premium first class lounges. Boarding was on time and effortless, again as due to my status I was able to board first. Seating, the aircraft was an old 777-200 and the seating and equipment reflected this. Perhaps I was spoiled by flying business class but I found the seating very tight and cramped. The inflight entertainment was also very old and limited. I am aware that SIA is introducing the new B787 for the SIN to PER route, this change is well overdue. Another item is the the inflight duty free shipping, we have tried on 4 different flights to buy a certain perfume which is listed in their catalog but it was not available as well as other male colognes listed.

Singapore Airlines is very dependable and the standards always high as is expected of a 5-star airline. The check-in counters are almost always free or have no more than one other guest in front of you. This is something I never take for granted and often a welcomed relief especially if I have travelled quite far to get to the airport. Knowing that check-ins can be done in under 5 mins from reaching the airport is an experience I've always looked forward to when flying with SQ, no matter which country I am in. The check-in staff are always pleasant and polite which sets the tone for the rest of the journey. The welcoming experience is often replicated at boarding when a senior cabin crew checks my boarding pass and welcomes me on board. SQ sets itself apart from the rest of the airlines by showcasing their best and possibly their most senior crew at the boarding area. The inflight entertainment offers an excellent selection of movies and shorter programmes. More importantly, Singapore Airlines allows passengers to use the inflight entertainment as soon as they are seated. The seat is slightly uncomfortable on the A330 in a full upright position but is fine once it can be reclined, even just slightly.

Lie down bed takes a bit of getting used to for set-up and pack away, but once you've got the hang of it, it's great. Helps you to sleep much more than when sitting. Meals were very nice and enjoyed book the cook options. The flight attendants felt the need to wake me for meals, even when I had put the Do Not Disturb button on. Perhaps they could say at the start of the flight when meals are expected, or allow you to choose a time within a certain range? The IFE was excellent with a good choice of recent and older movies. I found the headsets pushed into my ears, which got a bit sore after a couple of hours. I wear glasses, so that might be the reason.

Unfortunately, all we saw of Changi was what we saw while running through the terminal, owing to our first connecting flight being delayed, then our second going tek and requiring us to change aircraft many hours later than our departure time. We were handed forms at the departure gate and an invitation to contact Singapore Airlines for future incentives. Infact, what we got in reply, months later, was in short: 'Safety first; we don't compensate for delays or connections - if missed' (all our flights were SQ). Tough luck. Therefore our experience of SQ is one we wouldn't recommend and as they state, they wash their hands of you if you miss a connection even in the event that connecting flights are both SQ.

For a bit of extra room, I'd recommend the first row (Row 11) of business as there is a bit more leg space.

Most people needed assistance from the flight attendants to switch between the flat bed and regular seating positions. Meals are ok but nothing great. The in flight entertainment is below average. There is the annoying halt for just over an hour in Tokyo where all passengers have to disembark and go through security before re-boarding the aircraft.

Singapore to Tokyo Narita.  Premium Economy Class Seats: Wider and well-cushioned. However, we were disappointed with quality. The buttons for recline and the foot rest was not working well. We actually had to force the foot rest out. This certainly isn't expected for Singapore Airlines (ANA on the contrary had everything in tip top condition). Entertainment: One of the airlines with the most decent entertainment. However, my headset was faulty. It was replaced but again, not expected. It should have been checked. Food: I used ""Book the Cook'. I expected the food to be better but found it so-so. Cabin crew took a really long time to clear the food. When I tried to return it, I was flatly rejected, the crew told me to wait. The entire process from start to end took 2 hours! It was crazy! SQ 633 was way much more efficient. Crew was pretty cheerful and the crew made the effort to confirm our meals with us before they took off. They surprised us with an anniversary cake as well. We like the customer engagement they provided. SQ 12 on the other hand appeared grouchy and unhappy to me - no confirmation on the food was made and they took so long to finish the meal service. Premium Economy has a cabin on its own. However, on both flights, the curtains were not drawn. We had passengers from Economy trying to sneak into the Premium Economy seats or use the toilets in Business Class. There were also kids (in Economy class) walking to and fro the Premium Economy cabins. This should have been controlled as my husband was trying to do some work on the plane and I was trying to rest but could not. While I try to be understanding on young children in the plane, it is definitely awful to have a child crying/screaming for 6 hours on a 7 hours flight. What made it worse was that seats with bassinets in the Economy class were directly behind the Premium Economy class. Overall, we were not very impressed with the quality of Premium Economy Class.

I got an email early morning on 9 January to notify me that the flight  was to be delayed by 2 hours. As I was connecting with Air New Zealand at Singapore onwards to Auckland with a short connection time, I thought the chance of catching the connecting flight to Auckland was going to be impossible. That proved correct. Prior to arriving at the airport, I rung both SQ and Air New Zealand. Both airlines claimed it was each other’s responsibility. In short, SQ was to blame for the disruption, so it was their responsibility to put things right. When we were due to board at Frankfurt, the A380 was not at the terminal, it was at a distant part of the airport so we were bussed to the plane which seemed to be miles away. When we finally arrived at the plane, we had to climb a set of steep stairs to enter the plane. Considering the delayed flight and the inconvenience we had been through, the greeting from the staff was very ho-hum. The crew seemed to be grumpy during this flight. The poor guy in front of me had a seat adjacent to the galley door way. He asked to be reseated somewhere else in the business section. The stewardess’s response was, sorry, we are fully booked. This wasn’t the case as there was a vacant seat behind me. The meals were very Asian, with a lot of seafood options, in some cases I chose to forego the course as there was just nothing I liked. I would recommend SQ’s “book the cook” option. There are far more options available using this than SQ offers on the flight. Come time to sleep, my bed was broken. It lay flat ok, its just that when I put my weight on the bed the feet end of the bed couldn’t sustain the weight and my feet would go right through to the floor. I slept, but it wasn’t great. I wasn’t the only one to complain of this problem. When the flight arrived in Singapore there were a team of SQ agents waiting for arriving passengers whose connecting flights were affected by the delay. In all fairness, SQ did handle this very well, they provided a 4 star airport hotel for 12 hours along with 3 meals. The journey on to New Zealand continued with SQ and I can basically say, I saw a repeat of the service issues I had on the Frankfurt/Singapore flight. I can’t recommend SQ and probably won’t chose to fly with them again.The meals were very Asian",2018,01,24,frankfurt business class got email early morning january notify delayed hours connecting air new zealand onwards auckland short connection time thought chance catching connecting auckland going impossible proved correct prior arriving airport rung sq air new zealand claimed other’s responsibility short sq blame disruption responsibility put things right due board frankfurt not terminal distant part airport bussed seemed miles away finally arrived climb set steep stairs enter considering delayed inconvenience greeting staff hohum crew seemed grumpy poor guy front seat adjacent galley door way asked reseated somewhere else business section stewardess’s response sorry fully booked wasn’t case vacant seat behind meals asian lot seafood options cases chose forego course nothing liked would recommend sq’s “book cook” option far options available using sq offers come time sleep bed broken lay flat ok put weight bed feet end bed couldn’t sustain weight feet would go right floor slept but wasn’t great wasn’t one complain problem arrived team sq agents waiting arriving passengers whose connecting flights affected delay fairness sq handle well provided star airport hotel hours along meals journey new zealand continued sq basically say saw repeat service issues frankfurtsingapore can’t recommend sq probably won’t chose fly againthe meals asian,0.07720182116733841,1353,198

Special meal service was kind although a bit disappointing as you do not decide what meal you would like to eat but it is already prepared generic “western style” of whatever meal selection chosen. I would’ve loved to pick my meal with the changes applied, especially knowing tickets were booked ahead enough. Food was decent, but often the crew would overlook my seat and miss out several beverage//snack passes due to special needs. This was not at all an issue flying USA to Japan. But an issue on this flight. Main complaint is how crew could’ve done better to handle special requests with passengers. I booked and had a seat arranged, by surprise there were no shows in my row. Instead of privately making me aware of any request, an attendant publicly asked for my seating reassignment so that I may switch places with another passenger so that they my lie across the row with their bad knee. I’m partially deaf in one ear and spinal braced. Instead of privately requesting in writing, the crew member and requesting passenger makes a scene for me to move because I am unable to hear. So speaking louder while in flight should be better. There should be a better way for flight crew to handle those with special needs such as mute, deafness, and hidden disabilities instead of causing a scene or skipping passengers who cannot speak.

I decided to sleep through the long flight. Feeling cold, I tucked myself in with blankets. The middle seat person apparently had to exit his seat numerous times. Instead of exiting from his right, where a gentleman was seated,who was not sleeping, was not working, was not tucked in, nor was he sleeping, he decided to pass through my seat.

Ground staff assistance was great, Both the employees of Changi Airport as well Singapore Airlines helped us in every aspect. They unloaded and stored our luggage, helped us with immigration and the transport to the hospital. Our baby was admitted in the Hospital. During those days, we had steady contact with SIA. They rebooked our flight 2 times (as the doctors couldn't say for sure when our baby will be discharged) with no extra charge and being very supportive. As i understood, our price saver tickets gave them no obligation to do this for free - but to our great relief they did. They really gave us help and support in this hard time for us, showing us that even in todays world there is place for compassion. That there are times when paragraphs and formal rules are less important than the care for people in need and worry.

The attentive crew made flying long haul by economy into a lovely experience. From Brisbane, the B777-200er plane was a bit dated, noisy and the seats were comparatively hard. Some seats have IFE boxes taking up some foot space, and the entertainment selection is more limited than the newer planes (e.g. No full box sets). However the crew service with hot towels, amenities packs and attention to detail more than made up for it. The first leg was late departing Brisbane, but without even having to ask, the staff on the ground assured us by announcement that we would make up time en route and sure enough, we did, even arriving early into Changi. This was a relief for me as I only had a 50 minute connection time. The plane change at Changi was easy and seamless. The second leg was on the B77-300er. I found this plane less quiet than the A380 alternative on this leg, but still very comfortable. The ambient lighting and temperature were pleasant.

The cabin crew in general was warm, and tended to our needs promptly throughout the flight. However the Boeing 777-200ER, is one of the more antiquated aircraft in SQ's fleet and it is in desperate need of a makeover - for one, the IFE looked like something that came from the 1990s or the early 2000s, and the IFE was not very responsive, and ended up jamming up 1hr before landing in Hong Kong. If that was not bad enough, my friend who was seated next to me(seat 45B) suffered from less legroom than other economy class passengers due to the IFE box that was under the seat in front of his. However, the service from the flight attendants was outstanding-no surprises as to why SQ can consistently rank as one of the top airlines. On the return flight, the equipment was the same; however, the aircraft came in late, and departure was delayed by 15 minutes! On top of that, after boarding we could not push back due to ""traffic congestion"" and ended up taking off 1 hour behind schedule!

My wife and I had a booking for March 2018 to fly Canberra Australia to Wellington New Zealand, one way. This relates to customer service pre-flight, not comfort or service on a flight. Booking was no problem and great price. Our dates were not flexible due to other commitments. We received notification that our flight was cancelled (by the airline) and we had the option to accept an alternative (suggested flights nominated) or decline. Choosing decline gave a direction to call their help line. Called the number and despite stating our case several times that as there was no suitable alternative we would request refund we kept being offered alternative dates. Finally our request was understood (we were dealing with a human) and we were told that the operator did not have authority to action that request and our request would be forwarded to another area who would get back to us ""soon"". When asked for a timeframe we couldn't be given one. Now, I would expect that as this was the airline making the change, and, knowing that choosing decline would generate calls to the help line, a professional outfit would have provided that option for operators to action. But, no. It took a follow up email and then a second phone call to finally be advised that our request to cancel was actioned. When asked when we could expect a refund in our account we are told up to four weeks!! And, no advice of the amount to be actually refund, we have to wait for it to turn up before we can be sure full refund. Not good enough, and not what I would have expected from a full service airline that apparently prides itself on customer service.

Instead of pressing a button, you have to flip over the seat back to convert it to bed mode but the good thing is that the bed is wider than other business class seats which deploy using a button.

The big plane factor here matters, as the smaller planes tend to be parked away from the terminal and thus the passenger has to take a bus to the main terminal.

I bought and paid for four preferred seats. I have replacement knees and whilst they slightly limit my mobility, they do not adversely impact on my upper body strength or general fitness. The preferred seats would have given me more leg freedom. I purchased the preferred seats on-line and disclosed that I had a mobility problem. The tickets were sold with full disclosure by me. On the flights, we were refused the seats. It was then explained to me that it was the decision of the Cabin Crew ""on the day"" whether a person could occupy the preferred seats or not. We were moved further back down (both) aircraft and other people were seated in the preferred seats at no cost to themselves. It seems that the cabin crew make a decision whether the people in preferred seats are fit enough to assist other passengers in the event of an emergency. A total farce really, because they do allow women with babies to utilise these spaces. (So much for being fit enough to assist) On the last flight, the senior Cabin Crew person indicated she was submitting a report to assist me in having the money returned. I wrote to Singapore Airlines in late August. My email was acknowledged, then no further contact was received. I rang the Sydney office today and was told the money would not be refunded because the Airlines has a ""Not Negotiable/No Refund policy on preferred seat sales. My point is that those seats should not have been sold to anyone without a clear indication that it was a decision for the Cabin Crew ""on the day.""

Both cabins were the new Business fit out and the seats (11K and 11A respectively) were of the new set up. The only issue is that I think there is a lack of storage space, and no drink tray (which is available on the A380) The A350 arrangement is newer of course and the individual cabin seems a bit smaller than those on the A380 and B777 (although the seat is the same width as on the B777). In reality the size seems to be on a good scale and uses the space well - it is very comfortable and all works well, and very roomy. Interestingly we were handed a small amenities kit on the Singapore to Barcelona flight - a first in my experience with SIA. The service on both flights was top notch and the attendants very friendly and attentive. The A350 flight seemed to be full, but the service was of a very high standard. We had a short stopover in Milan where we had to remain on the plane and there was a crew change. One of the flight attendants came up to say goodbye as she was leaving the plane. Very personal service. The A350 is a terrific plane - very quiet (much more so than the B777) and very smooth. I did feel better after this flight than other long haul flights so maybe the extra humidity and air pressure and better air conditioning worked. Meals and drinks were of a high standard and the toilet to passenger ratio seemed good. The only slightly negative thing was the Silver Kris lounge in Singapore - very crowded, and the showers are showing their age.

When booking the trip I took into account that the connection time in HKG was only 1 hour and 50 minutes between my SK flight and the Singapore flight. Being a frequent traveller with SAS I already asked to have my luggage checked through to Kuala Lumpur at Oslo airport, which was a very good choice as thus the SIngapore ground staff was prepared when the SK flight arrived in Hong Kong with a 80 minute delay. Despite I made it to the departure gate on my connection at last minute - exhausted after a long run through Hong Kong airport, the Singapore ground staff had already made a arrangement for me and my colleague to be booked on the next machine as the earlier flight had been anyway full.

We booked 5 seats in a row, 3 on the left side and the next 2 seats in the middle. Flying economy, our expectations were fairly low, but we were pleasantly surprised by the seats. The legroom was large, the seats were decently comfortable and in-flight entertainment system was excellent. Before taking off, the crew handed out hot towels and the menu, which was very nice. Shortly after take-off, the service began with a smaller snack before the stop in Moscow. Here, all passengers had to get off the airplane, even if you continued to Singapore. Moscow was an annoying but thankfully short stop. Be prepared to show your passport/bording pass 4-5 times though, as there were several controls, and one proper security checkpoint. Nothing insufferable, but annoying nonetheless. After taking off again from Moscow, the rest of the trip was a breeze. The service from the crew was excellent, with food, beverages and complimentary items. It was a 10 hour flight but it went by quickly thanks to the wonderful seat back entertainment system. There were more movies than you could ever hope to watch during a flight, as well as games, tv-series, books and music, all of it free! The only thing you had to pay for was the wifi. As such, I didn't check the cost, since I had enough free entertainment. As we began our descent the crew cleaned up nicely, and handed out the necessary immigration forms, if needed.

Our outbound leg was operated by a brand new A350. Despite the usually unremarkable ground service in CGK, we walked into the plane with high expectations, being known as a prestigious carrier here in Indonesia. Our previous flights with them has also been excellent. However, walking out of a Singapore Airlines plane for the first time in three years left us wanting for more. Sure, the A350 was an excellent aircraft in itself, with a spacious cabin, larger windows, high-tech LCDs for overhead signs and increased humidity, but unfortunately the flight experience overall has fallen miserably compared to our past flights with them as well as with competing airlines. Seat comfort was good but not great due to the hard leather headrests. Seat width was great, while pitch was nothing remarkable. Service was noticeably rushed, though crew were still professional, efficient and quite friendly. IFE was the most sophisticated and content-loaded I have ever experienced - complete with an extremely high resolution remote controller. However, it was not useful other than accessing shortcuts and viewing brief flight information. And then the food came: every single portion of the meal was lackluster - very severely below industry standards. Also, the ding sounds were played excessively throughout the flight, at an ear-splitting volume - they rung at least once every thirty seconds. How incredible. What's more, turbulence kept coming and going throughout the entire flight as well, and when it was time to land, we hit the ground very hard. Kudos to the pilot. The return flight was operated by a 16-year old 777-300, a stark contrast to the brand new A350 of the previous flight. However, this was much better: food quality was raised to industry standards - good, but not great, service was friendlier, but still far from the best out there, seat comfort was elevated thanks in part to the very soft and plush leather headrests; the constant ding sounds were replaced by an overall calmer ride interspersed with brief periods of turbulence. But what impressed me was the amount of space that each passenger in Economy Class receives: the amount of legroom was mind blowing. I could stretch out and still not feel claustrophobic. However, this flight also comes with its own share of flaws: crew service was not as efficient - they spent the first 20 minutes of cruise heating up food, and this caused my row to get the food only 30 minutes before arrival, and we finished our desserts as the plane was already midway through descent. Also, the IFE system is ancient and is in desperate need for a upgrade. The screens were also falling apart as well. Overall an inconsistent experience onboard SQ that has slightly declined since I flew them last three years ago.an inconsistent experience onboard",2017,07,20,flew jakarta return outbound leg operated brand new despite usually unremarkable ground service cgk walked high expectations known prestigious carrier indonesia previous flights also excellent however walking first time three years left us wanting sure excellent aircraft spacious cabin larger windows hightech lcds overhead signs increased humidity but unfortunately experience overall fallen miserably compared past flights well competing seat comfort good but not great due hard leather headrests seat width great pitch nothing remarkable service noticeably rushed though crew still professional efficient quite friendly ife sophisticated contentloaded ever experienced complete extremely high resolution remote controller however not useful accessing shortcuts viewing brief information food came every single portion meal lackluster severely industry standards also ding sounds played excessively throughout earsplitting volume rung least every thirty seconds incredible whats turbulence kept coming going throughout entire well time land hit ground hard kudos pilot return operated old stark contrast brand new previous however much better food quality raised industry standards good but not great service friendlier but still far best seat comfort elevated thanks part soft plush leather headrests constant ding sounds replaced overall calmer ride interspersed brief periods turbulence but impressed amount space passenger economy class receives amount legroom mind blowing could stretch still not feel claustrophobic however also comes share flaws crew service not efficient spent first minutes cruise heating food caused row get food minutes arrival finished desserts already midway descent also ife system ancient desperate need upgrade screens also falling apart well overall inconsistent experience onboard sq slightly declined since flew last three years agoan inconsistent experience onboard,0.10154325206956785,1905,260

Inattentive staff, cold food, broken in-flight entertainment equipment and terrible service.  I was with a friend when I boarded this flight and going back to Singapore after a semester of studies in Perth. We just had a rude encounter with a staff at the boarding gate and was hoping to get a warm welcome from fellow Singaporeans on the SIA flight. However we were received with hostile treatment from the cabin staff serving us on the flight. Had to pass through 5 flight attendants before we finally got an apple juice. First 2 attendants conveniently missed us when serving drinks to other passengers. The next 2 forgot our orders. Throughout these 5 encounters, we were received with rude attitudes which irritated, annoyed and angered us. It was a truly frustrating flight. A flight attendant also missed me when serving meals, had to be served by another from the other aisle. Apart from that, in-flight entertainment was faulty, didnt bother to announce before rebooting and after restarting. My remote had 1 button missing. Meals were not hot and rice was hard. I had previously tried Scoot for the first time from Singapore to Perth. Although the food was terrible, they provided a quality of service that could rival a full service airline and definitely beat the one provided by SQ on this particular flight.  Before this flight, I absolutely adored SQ. Now, I am seriously considering boycotting this airline for the treatment I received on flight. I seriously wonder if the old cabin crew who had built up such a wonderful reputation for SQ had moved on to serve in Scoot.

It does not make sense to serve a heavy dinner at that odd time. Instead they could serve a good breakfast at around 7 am (PST). Then only snacks for the entire flight and another heavy meal just an hour before landing. This thing is a nuisance because you cant really enjoy a meal if you know you have to land in another hour. The breakfast served on the HKG-SIN sector was good and well timed. The toilets were clean and had the basic amenities. IFE was good on both flights.

We expected Singapore Airlines, another favourite carrier, to offer a similar product, and we had both had good Singapore Airlines flights before. But this flight was a terrible disappointment, and poor value for money. We are not looking forward to the return flight next month. With Singapore Airlines premium economy, you get a wider seat and better leg room. At the airport you check in separately, and there's a more generous luggage allowance. But that's all you get. We got the same food as economy (poor food compared to previous Singapore Airlines economy flights). The flight attendants served us and a large chunk of economy. Perhaps they were run off their feet: the only smiles were the neon-light style: turn on a smile and instantly turn it off again. When the food trolley came along there was a bottle of red and and a bottle of white wine on the top, but it was not offered. We were asked simply whether we wanted tea or coffee. I requested a glass of red, and was given it. I've no idea what sort of wine it was. The curried beef meal was poor economy class food at best, and far from what Singapore Airlines has offered in the past. Nobody came around after the meal to offer more wine, tea of coffee. After each meal, it took half an hour for anyone to come and remove our trays, so we were stuck in our seats and unable to go the toilet. My wife eventually lost patience and took her tray and returned it to the kitchen herself. Flight attendants were there, but offered no thanks or apology for the delay in retrieving the trays. On the long night flight leg to London a day later it was much the same. We were not even offered eye masks, though I was given one when I requested it. I've never flown an international night flight before when an eye mask wasn't offered. The curtain between premium economy and economy was never closed on either flight, and children from economy wandered into our aisle at will. As we approached London, our last meal was a breakfast omelet of rubbery texture, which seemed to underscore the whole mediocre experience this premium economy flight had been. But it hadn't finished yet: On arrival at Heathrow, people in economy poured from their seats into our part of the aircraft before the seatbelt light had been turned off. No flight attendants told them to stay in their seats until those ahead of them had got off, not even a cabin announcement. Most cabin announcements during were barely audible, even in an aircraft as quiet as an A380, so that might not have made much of a difference. To sum up: we used to praise Singapore Airlines to the skies, but the scales have fallen from our eyes.This was an appalling way to start our holiday, and it will take a lot to get us to return to flying with this airline again.this flight was a terrible disappointment",2017,06,21,wife flew london last week stopover choosing premium economy great experience flying qantas premium economy expected another favourite carrier offer similar product good flights but terrible disappointment poor value money not looking forward return next month premium economy get wider seat better leg room airport check separately theres generous luggage allowance but thats get got food economy poor food compared previous economy flights attendants served us large chunk economy perhaps run off feet smiles neonlight style turn smile instantly turn off food trolley came along bottle red bottle white wine top but not offered asked simply whether wanted tea coffee requested glass red given ive no idea sort wine curried beef meal poor economy class food best far offered past nobody came around meal offer wine tea coffee meal took half hour anyone come remove trays stuck seats unable go toilet wife eventually lost patience took tray returned kitchen attendants but offered no thanks apology delay retrieving trays long night leg london day later much not even offered eye masks though given one requested ive never flown international night eye mask wasnt offered curtain premium economy economy never closed either children economy wandered aisle will approached london last meal breakfast omelet rubbery texture seemed underscore whole mediocre experience premium economy but hadnt finished yet arrival heathrow people economy poured seats part aircraft seatbelt light turned off no attendants told stay seats ahead got off not even cabin announcement cabin announcements barely audible even aircraft quiet might not made much difference sum used praise skies but scales fallen eyesthis appalling way start holiday will take lot get us return flying againthis terrible disappointment,-0.03261351052048726,1793,272

We had the approval letter from the Vietnamese Immigration letter which was shown to them. The only requirement is to have the approval letter and pay for the visa on arrival. This information was co-overrated by the Immigration department in Vietnam upon our arrival to HCMC. It is also important to note that this wasn't our first time in Vietnam and no airline staff has ever asked us for an outgoing flight. What really makes me angry though is that their ground crew left it to the very last minute to ask us for the return flight. It was an incredibly stressful booking a flight on the spot, only having 10 minutes or so to do it. We almost missed our flight because of their incompetence. To make matters worse the cabin crew was incredibly rude and unpleasant. One of the staff members didn't even bother to use the word please. How can these people work in the travel/tourism industry?

I have been flying with Singapore Airlines in Economy a couple of times in the past and was under the impression that I really like flying with them. However, my recent two legs felt mediocre at best and made me question my general stance. The crews seemed disorganized, very mechanic, and provided slightly chaotic and/or unnecessary stressed meal services. The first beverage service consisted of pre-filled cups with wine and beer served from a tray that the FA carried through the aisle. Kinda strange. Why not hand out little wine bottles (as Lufthansa does) and cans of beers instead? If no one takes the cups, do they pour them out? The planes were fairly old, featuring ancient inflight systems. I also dislike with Singapore Airlines that during online set selection, one is only being shown very few available seats - and when you sit down, the seats that were shown occupied suddenly are empty, while the one next to you which was shown available is occupier. I understand that there always are last minute changes but I still notice a repeating pattern; with other airlines (within Star Alliance) I usually am able to make smarter seat choices than when flying with SIA. The food was good. Overall, if Singapore Airline wants to maintain its position as a serious premium airline, it has to improve the overall pleasantness of the flight experience. The fare was not cheap (yet the booking class made it hard to earn miles outside of Krisflyer), and mediocre doesn't justify a significant higher price than what the low cost competion offers.improve the overall pleasantness",2017,05,27,hong kong surabaya via flying economy couple times past impression really like flying however recent two legs felt mediocre best made question general stance crews seemed disorganized mechanic provided slightly chaotic andor unnecessary stressed meal services first beverage service consisted prefilled cups wine beer served tray fa carried aisle kinda strange not hand little wine bottles lufthansa cans beers instead if no one takes cups pour planes fairly old featuring ancient inflight systems also dislike online set selection one shown available seats sit down seats shown occupied suddenly empty one next shown available occupier understand always last minute changes but still notice repeating pattern within star alliance usually able make smarter seat choices flying sia food good overall if wants maintain position serious premium improve overall pleasantness experience fare not cheap yet booking class made hard earn miles outside krisflyer mediocre doesnt justify significant higher price low cost competion offersimprove overall pleasantness,0.04032118055555556,1056,152
